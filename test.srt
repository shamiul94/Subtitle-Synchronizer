1
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,904
This man is worth 500 dollars.

2
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:25,756
And this man's going to collect.

3
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:29,153
He's Jake Cahill
and he lives by

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,439
Bounty Law.

5
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:33,266
You don't ever bring men
alive, now do you, Jake?

6
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:35,504
Not when there's three
of them and one of me.

7
00:00:41,027 --> 00:00:42,837
What are you lookin' at,
bounty killer?

8
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,965
Lookin' at an ugly owl hoot
'bout to get his jaw busted.

9
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:49,440
Amateurs try and
take men in alive.

10
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:53,255
Amateurs usually don't make it.

11
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,242
Whether you're dead or alive,
you're just a dollar sign to

12
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:59,053
Jake Cahill on
Bounty Law.

13
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:02,294
Thursdays at 8:30.
Only on NBC.

14
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:07,241
Hello, everybody!

15
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,327
This is Allen Kincaid on
the set of the exciting hit

16
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,098
NBC and Screen Gems
television series

17
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:13,214
Bounty Law.

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,034
Now, if you think
you're seeing double,

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,567
don't adjust your
television sets

20
00:01:16,592 --> 00:01:18,592
because, well,
in a way, you are.

21
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,695
To my right is
Bounty Law series lead

22
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:23,139
and Jake Cahill himself,
Rick Dalton.

23
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:25,796
And to my left is Rick's
stunt double, Cliff Booth.

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,149
Welcome, gentlemen and

25
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:28,705
thanks for taking the
time to visit with us.

26
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,245
Well, it's our pleasure, Al.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,193
So, Rick, uh, explain
to the audience

28
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:34,741
exactly what it is
a stunt double does.

29
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,592
Well...

30
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:40,425
Actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

31
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,095
Say, Jake Cahill gets
shot off a horse...

32
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:45,689
Now, can I fall off a horse?

33
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:48,205
Yes, I can, yes, I have.

34
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,266
Let's say I fall off
wrong and I

35
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:56,847
and I sprain my wrist or I-
or I twist my ankle, now...

36
00:01:56,907 --> 00:01:59,208
that can put an undue
burden on production

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,772
'cause now maybe I
can't work for a week.

38
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:04,539
So, Cliff here is meant
to help carry the load.

39
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:06,748
Is that, uh, how you
describe your job, Cliff?

40
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,510
What, carrying his load?

41
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:10,424
Yeah, that's about right.

42
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,787
Join me next week on the set
of The Dick Van Dyke Show

43
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:18,560
where I'll be talking
to those comical cut-ups

44
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:20,657
Morey Amsterdam
and Rose Marie.

45
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:24,110
Till then, this is Allen Kincaid

The face in the misty light.

83
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,808
Hello, Mr. Schwarz.

84
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:02,158
Whoa, Gina.

85
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:05,197
I, uh, I have a meeting
with a very handsome

86
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:06,609
cowboy man.

87
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:08,189
He's waiting for you in the bar.

88
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:11,752
Well...

89
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:13,760
since I just finished watching

90
00:05:13,866 --> 00:05:15,937
a Rick Dalton
fucking film festival,

91
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:17,686
I think I know who you are.

92
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:18,822
Put it there.

93
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,639
Well, it's my
pleasure, Mr. Schwartz,

94
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:23,782
a-and thank you
for taking an interest.

95
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:25,326
Schwarz not Schwartz.

96
00:05:25,504 --> 00:05:28,154
Goddammit to hell,
I'm-I'm sorry about that.

97
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,198
My pleasure, Mr. Schwarz.

98
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,550
- Call me Marvin.
- Marvin, call me Rick.

99
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,869
Rick. Oh, that your son?

100
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:36,212
My son...

101
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:39,090
No, that's my stunt double
Cliff Booth, yeah.

102
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:40,114
Good to meet you.

103
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,454
We've worked together
since the, uh,

104
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,296
the last two seasons
of Bounty Law.

105
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:44,553
- Yeah.
- My car's in the shop.

106
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:45,912
He gave me a ride.

107
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,686
<i>That's a big fuckin' lie.</i>

<i>Rick got his driver's

111
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,343
Oh, fuck.

112
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,262
Sounds like a good friend.

113
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,477
I try.

114
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:00,044
I want to send you
greetings from my wife,

115
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,498
Mary Alice Schwarz.

116
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:04,085
Oh, well, that's nice.

117
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,792
Thanks a lot.

118
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,359
We had...

119
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:15,161
a Rick Dalton double feature in
our screening room last night.

120
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,483
Oh, well...

121
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:19,364
That's both flattering
and embarrassing.

122
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,290
What'd you see?

123
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,134
35mm prints...

124
00:06:23,277 --> 00:06:26,769
of Tanner and
The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

125
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,222
I hope the uh...

126
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,571
Rick Dalton uh, double
feature wasn't too uh...

127
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,542
painful for you and the-
and the missus.

128
00:06:39,602 --> 00:06:42,181
Oh, no. Painful. Stop.

129
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:43,890
What are you saying?

130
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,710
<i>Mary Alice loves Westerns.</i>

131
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,247
<i>Our whole courtship,
we watched Westerns.</i>

132
00:06:49,602 --> 00:06:52,547
<i>And we thoroughly enjoyed them.</i>

133
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:53,989
- Oh, that's nice.
- Really good.

134
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:55,134
And um,

135
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:56,705
anyway, she goes to bed.

<i>I light up.</i>

<i>I pour myself a cognac.</i>

139
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,173
<i>And I watch...</i>

140
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,307
The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

141
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,201
What a picture.

142
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:12,242
- What a picture.
- Good picture, yeah.

143
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:14,154
Got to be so much fun.

144
00:07:14,186 --> 00:07:15,251
All the shooting.

145
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,537
I love that stuff,
you know, the killing.

146
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:23,159
A lotta killing, a lotta killing.

147
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,724
So gentlemen,

148
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:27,224
the plan is we
reverse our forces

149
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:29,430
und drive the Allies
back into the sea!

150
00:07:40,553 --> 00:07:42,083
There's nowhere to go.

151
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,280
Hermann!

152
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:50,105
Open the curtains!

153
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,594
<i>Jawohl!</i>

154
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,522
Anybody order fried sauerkraut?!

155
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:32,129
Burn, you Nazi basterds!

156
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,673
That's you operating the
flamethrower, isn't it?

157
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:38,956
Oh, you bet your sweet ass
it was, yeah, yeah.

158
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,042
It was you?

159
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,548
Yeah, l-let me tell you,
th-th-that's

160
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:43,136
one shitfuck crazy weapon.

161
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:46,801
Y-You do not want to be on
the wrong side of, boy, oh, boy.

162
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,683
Now, I-I practiced
with that dragon, uh...

163
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:51,725
three hours a day for two weeks.

164
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:54,220
N-Not just 'cause I wanted
to look good in the picture

165
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:55,435
but because I was

166
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,729
I was shit scared of the
damn thing, to be honest.

167
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,575
Might fucking lose!

168
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:01,781
Crisp in a massive death!

169
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,812
All right, that's too hot.

170
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,792
Anything we could
do about that heat?

171
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,761
Rick, it's a flamethrower.

172
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:09,983
Yeah.

173
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,674
So I came to the
office early today...

174
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,698
and I watched

175
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:17,584

176
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:19,030

00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,270
And you brought him
here to collect.

181
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,583
I don't even know
where here is.

182
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:34,797
This was the closest place.

183
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:38,031
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

184
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:39,865
So, bounty killer...

185
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,906
the name of this
town is Janustown.

186
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,341
That boy you killed...

187
00:09:48,357 --> 00:09:49,785
Jodey Janus...

188
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:55,109
he was the baby boy of
Major Nathan Maxwell Janus.

189
00:09:57,251 --> 00:10:01,243
Who is...
Major Nathan Maxwell Janus?

190
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:06,317
Well, I'll be sure

guest shots on uh,
episodic TV shows

206
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,698
the last couple of years.

207
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:12,340
Yeah, yeah, uh...

208
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:15,809
I'm doin' a-a pilot
for CBS right now.

209
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:17,856
It's called Lancer.

210
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,063
I play the heavy.

211
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:22,118
Did a... Ron Ely Tarzan
and uh...

212
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:24,265
Land of the Giants,
Green Hornet.

213
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,037
I did that show...

214
00:11:26,156 --> 00:11:29,394
Bingo Martin with
that kid Scott Brown.

215
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:32,976
And I got a FBI
that airs this Sunday.

216
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:36,700
You uh, you always play
the bad guy on these shows?

217
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,775
Yeah.

218
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:42,518
Mmm. So, and they have
a fight scene at the end?

219
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:46,652
Well, not...
Land of the Giants or FBI

220
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:48,366
but the rest, yeah.

221
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,155
And you lose in the fight?

222
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:53,320
Yeah, of course.
I'm the heavy

223
00:11:53,716 --> 00:11:57,851
Oh... that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.

224
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,355
You take Bingo Martin

225
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,054
- for example.
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:04,147
So, you got a new guy
like Scott Brown.

227
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:07,108
You want to build up
his bona fide.

228
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:11,240
So you hire a guy from a
canceled show to play the heavy.

229
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:14,418
Then at the end of the
show when they fight...

230
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:16,723
it's hero besting heavy.

231
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:21,109
But, what the audience
sees is Bingo Martin...

232
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:24,387
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

233
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:25,887
You see?

234
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:27,577
Then next week,

235
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,283
it's Ron Ely.

236
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:31,518
The next week it's...

237
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:34,553
Bob Conrad wearing
his tight pants...

238
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:36,080
kicking your ass.

239
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,270
Yeah.

240
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:40,756
Now in another couple of
years playing punching bag

241
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:43,218
to every swinging dick
new to the network,

242
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:46,661
it's gonna have a
psychological effect

243
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:50,029
on how the audience
perceives you.

244
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:51,117
Right.

245
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,423
So, Rick...

246
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:56,137
who's gonna kick the shit
outta you next week?

247
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:57,483
Mannix?

248
00:12:57,824 --> 00:12:59,261
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

249
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:01,165
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

250
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:05,552
How about Batman and Robin?
Ping! Pow!

251
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:07,810
Chum! Zoom!

252
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:11,012
Down goes you.

253
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:13,996
Down goes your career
as a leading man.

254
00:13:16,377 --> 00:13:19,298
Or do you go to Rome

255
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:21,449
and star in Westerns?

256
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,804
And win fucking fights.

257
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:38,444
Muchas gracias.

258
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,957
All right, what the
matter, partner?

259
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,290
It's official, old buddy.

260
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:49,036
I'm a has-been.

261
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:51,712
What are you talkin' about?
What'd that guy tell you?

262
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:53,669
Told me the goddamn
truth is what he told me.

263
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:58,135
Whoa, whoa.

264
00:13:58,769 --> 00:13:59,769
Hey.

265
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:01,317
I'm sorry 'bout that.
Sorry 'bout that.

266
00:14:01,396 --> 00:14:02,645
Here, put these on.

267
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:05,244
Don't cry in front
of the Mexicans.

268
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:07,818
What's gotten you so upset, man?

269
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,073
Well, if coming
face to face with the

270
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:12,509
failure that is your career
ain't worth cryin' about,

271
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:14,224
then I don't know
what the fuck is.

272
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:16,293
Why? That guy in there
turn you down?

273
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:17,283
No.

274
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:19,830
He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.

275
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:21,413
Well, then, what's the problem?

276
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:23,404
I gotta do fuckin' Italian
goddamn movies!

277
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,794
That's the fuckin' problem.

278
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,502

I cry in public

00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:23,413
<i>Four men on a search</i>

356

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,934
That... That was Polanski.

365
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:48,484
That was Roman Polanski,
h-he's lived there for a month now.

366
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,070
First time I seen him.

367
00:18:51,062 --> 00:18:52,213
Holy shit.

00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:57,346
What I always say?

369
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,260
Most important thing in this town,
is when you're making money,

370
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,397
you buy a house in town,
you don't rent.

371
00:19:02,596 --> 00:19:04,032
Eddie O'Brien taught me that.

372
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:06,545

means you live here.

373

livin' next door to me?

378
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:19,041
The director of Rosemary's
fuckin' Baby, that's who.

379
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:21,338
Polanski's the hottest director
in town right now,

380
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:22,570
probably the world!

381
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,024
He's my next door
fuckin' neighbor.

382
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,258
Shit.

383
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:27,861

385

386
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:34,371
So, you're feeling better now?

387
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:36,234
Oh, yeah, yes.
Sorry 'bout all that.

She... was engaged to him.

554
00:30:46,098 --> 00:30:47,789
And she...

555
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:51,644
flew to the UK

556
00:30:52,195 --> 00:30:54,338
to make a film with him

557
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:57,806
and broke off her
engagement with him

558
00:30:57,953 --> 00:30:59,771
and married him.

559
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:04,997
Then they... moved to Los Angeles...

560
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:08,945
and then the three of 'em
have been inseparable.

561
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:11,370

- Howdy.

648

Now, I want a whole
new look for Caleb.

649
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:39,566
I don't want this Western
costume the way they costume

650
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:42,409
The Big Valley and Bonanza
from the last decade.

651
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:45,932
I want a zeitgeist
flair in the costumes.

652
00:35:47,135 --> 00:35:48,675
I mean, nothing anachronistic,

653
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,985

00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:55,945
Especially when it
comes to you, Caleb.

655
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:58,747
First off, I wanna
give him a mustache.

656
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:03,438
A big, droopy,
Zapata-like mustache.

657
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,840
Now, about his jacket...

658
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,959
I wanna give him a
hippie jacket.

659
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:10,328
Something that he could wear
into the London Fog tonight

660
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:12,315
and look like the
hippest guy in the room.

661
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:14,752
Far out.
We got a Custer jacket,

662
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,921
fringes all down the arm.

663
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:19,326
It's tan now,
but I dye it dark brown,

664
00:36:19,454 --> 00:36:21,184
he could hit the
strip in it tonight.

665
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:23,137
That's my girl.

666
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:25,112

667
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:26,707
W-What about my hair?

668
00:36:26,732 --> 00:36:28,391
I wanna go with a
different hairstyle.

669
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:29,968
Oh, what?

670
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:32,033
Something more... hippie-ish.

671
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,745
Well... you want me
to look like a hippie?

672
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:38,875
Well, think less hippie, more...

673
00:36:38,932 --> 00:36:40,431

674
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:46,192

675
00:36:47,609 --> 00:36:49,570
You got me covered up
in all this, uh...

676
00:36:49,705 --> 00:36:51,617
this... junk.

677
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:54,121
Uh, how's the audience
gonna know it's me?

678
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:56,226
I hope they don't.

679
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,165
Hmm.

680
00:36:57,925 --> 00:37:01,845
I don't want them to see
Jake Cahill.

681
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,981

728
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:48,123
Hey, Randy.

729
00:40:50,293 --> 00:40:51,381
Cliff.

730
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,087
So, you're still with Rick, huh?

731
00:40:54,928 --> 00:40:56,190
Still here.

732
00:40:57,381 --> 00:40:58,420
He in there?

733
00:40:58,532 --> 00:40:59,928
Yeah, just knock.

734
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,702
Look, j-just put him
into wardrobe, all right?

735
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:10,786
What's it gonna hurt? Then if you
need him, you got him, right?

736
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:14,551
Then I gotta have a conversation
with that wardrobe assistant,

737
00:41:14,576 --> 00:41:16,750
and man, she's a fuckin' bitch,
I just don't...

738
00:41:16,797 --> 00:41:19,846
Look, look, Randy, I'm askin'
you to help me out, man.

739
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:23,546
If the answer's no, the answer's no.
Not-Not no with excuses.

740
00:41:24,252 --> 00:41:25,617
Hey, man.

741
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:29,862
This ain't a fuckin'
Andy McLaglen picture, you know.

742
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:32,726
And I can't afford to hire a
bunch of guys to smoke cigarettes

743
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,571
and sit around talkin'
to each other all day

744
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:36,468
on the chance
that I might use 'em.

745
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,454
I got a four man team here, Rick.

746
00:41:38,521 --> 00:41:40,655
I need more than that,
I gotta get it approved.

747
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:42,941
And you know,
I-I gotta look after my dudes.

748
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:46,762
Hey, a-and if your dudes were
a better match for me,

749
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:48,365
I'd say, o-okay,
you got me, b-b-but

750
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,684
but th-that's not the case
and you know it.

751
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:51,819
He's a great fuckin'
match for me.

752
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:52,851
Yeah, yeah, I know.

753
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,860
Hey, you could do
anything you want to him.

754
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:57,136
Shit, th-throw him
off a building, right?

755
00:41:57,176 --> 00:41:59,977
Light him on fire, hit him
with a fucking Lincoln, right?

756
00:42:00,012 --> 00:42:01,813
Get creative,
do whatever you want.

757
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:03,415
He's just happy
for the opportunity.

758
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,345
Rick.

759
00:42:04,377 --> 00:42:05,369
Yeah.

760
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,258
I don't dig him.

761
00:42:11,298 --> 00:42:13,845
And I don't dig the
vibe he brings on set.

762
00:42:15,137 --> 00:42:17,548
What, is there some old
beef between you two?

763
00:42:17,573 --> 00:42:18,811
Come on, man.

764
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:19,821
What?

765
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:22,551
The dude killed his fuckin' wife.

766
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:25,217
Oh... come on, man.

767
00:42:25,265 --> 00:42:27,480
You don't believe
that old shit, do you?

768
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:29,179
Yes, Rick, I do.

769
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:32,161
And I work with my wife
and she believes it.

770
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:34,855
She didn't want his
creepy ass around.

771
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:40,686
You know, this is probably
the shittiest weather ever.

772
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:44,118
The shittiest weather
on the shittiest boat

773
00:42:44,142 --> 00:42:46,420
with the shittiest person.

774
00:42:47,656 --> 00:42:50,037
Natalie, my sister, said,
"He's a loser."

775
00:42:50,062 --> 00:42:51,099
"He's a loser."

776
00:42:51,131 --> 00:42:53,052
They all said it,
"He's a fuckin' loser",

777
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,447
and I didn't believe them.

778
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:56,472
So, I guess I'm
the fuckin' idiot.

779
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,219
And now you're
not gonna talk to me?

780
00:42:59,322 --> 00:43:01,354
What, you don't
feel like fighting?

781
00:43:01,723 --> 00:43:03,580
Well, I feel like fucking fight.

782
00:43:03,605 --> 00:43:06,715
And I've been up here
by myself for four hours

783
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,217
on this fucking
shithole of a boat...

784
00:43:09,818 --> 00:43:10,977
Yeah.

785
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:15,838
He's a goddamn war hero.

786
00:43:24,629 --> 00:43:26,605
Okay, you fuckin' horse's ass.

787
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:28,740
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

788
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:33,884
Now, I'll put you in wardrobe,

789
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:36,447
but you don't stunt,
I don't pay you.

790
00:43:36,683 --> 00:43:39,389
Appreciate the opportunity,
Randy. I won't let you down.

791
00:43:39,706 --> 00:43:42,032
You know my wife,
Janet, don't you?

792
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:43,783
Yeah.

793
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:45,521
Steer clear of her.

794
00:43:46,503 --> 00:43:49,407
Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.

795
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:51,029
What I admire is

796
00:43:51,054 --> 00:43:54,205
in his sport, there's
an element of true combat.

797
00:43:54,494 --> 00:43:57,034
When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

798
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:59,186
that's not two
athletes posturing.

799
00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:00,999
That's combat.

800
00:44:01,382 --> 00:44:04,286
Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

801
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:06,378
If you don't beat him,

802
00:44:07,036 --> 00:44:08,354
he kills you.

803
00:44:08,977 --> 00:44:10,644
That's beyond athletics.

804
00:44:10,744 --> 00:44:14,069
That's beyond Wide World of
Sports, you know?

805
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,398
That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

806
00:44:16,438 --> 00:44:18,327
That's what I admire.

807
00:44:18,972 --> 00:44:20,552
In martial arts tournaments,

808
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:23,980
they won't let you fight like that.
It's very frustrating.

809
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,849
You stand in front of a guy,

810
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:27,461
you just wanna let him have it.

811
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:30,245
But you can't.

812
00:44:30,404 --> 00:44:33,967
So you gotta do this
play-acting, pattycake version.

813
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,348
Cassius Clay,
Sonny Liston, Joe Lewis.

814
00:44:37,662 --> 00:44:40,686
The colored boxer,
not that white kickboxing asshole.

815
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,738
They do what they
need to do to win.

816
00:44:44,917 --> 00:44:47,498
They unleash as much
punishment as they have to

817
00:44:47,523 --> 00:44:49,642
to defeat the other guy.

818
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:51,699
But in martial arts tournaments,

819
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:54,254
I do to win what
they do to win.

820
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:57,226
I unleash all my power.

821
00:44:58,302 --> 00:44:59,461
I kill people.

822
00:44:59,852 --> 00:45:02,003
Well, if you fought
Cassius Clay, who would win?

823
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:05,065
Well, that would never happen.

824
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,216
But if you did, what do
you think would happen?

825
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:10,525
I'd make him a cripple.

826
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:14,650
Hey, you.

827
00:45:14,972 --> 00:45:16,225
What's your name?

828
00:45:16,337 --> 00:45:18,377
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

829
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:21,468
My name's Cliff.

830
00:45:21,745 --> 00:45:23,873
I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double.

831
00:45:23,966 --> 00:45:25,101
Stuntman?

832
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,545
Yeah.

833
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,841
You know, you're kind of
pretty for a stuntman.

834
00:45:29,151 --> 00:45:30,856
That's what they tell me.

835
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:34,710
So, did I say
something funny, stuntman?

836
00:45:35,226 --> 00:45:38,067
- Yeah, you kinda did.
- What's so funny?

837
00:45:38,373 --> 00:45:40,270
Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

838
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:41,945
I'm just here to do a job.

839
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:43,933
But you're laughing at
what I'm saying,

840
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:45,562
but I'm not saying
anything funny.

841
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,601
So, what do you
think is so funny?

842
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,944
What I think is...

843
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:56,299
you're a little man with a
big mouth and a big chip.

844
00:45:56,346 --> 00:45:57,981
And I think you
should be embarrassed

845
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,672
to suggest that you'd
be anything more

846
00:45:59,697 --> 00:46:02,721
than a stain on the seat of
Cassius Clay's trunks.

847
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,123
Brother...

848
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,083
you're the one
with the big mouth.

849
00:46:06,276 --> 00:46:07,887
And I would really
enjoy closing it

850
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:10,110
especially in front
of all my friends.

851
00:46:10,963 --> 00:46:14,058
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

852
00:46:14,419 --> 00:46:15,745
That means...

853
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,554
we get into a fight,
I accidentally kill you,

854
00:46:18,837 --> 00:46:20,258
I go to jail.

855
00:46:20,762 --> 00:46:24,089
Anybody accidentally kills
anybody in a fight, they go to jail.

856
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,551
It's called manslaughter.

857
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:28,258
And I think all that lethal weapon
horseshit is just an excuse

858
00:46:28,283 --> 00:46:31,118
so you dancers never have
to get in a real fight.

859
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:34,128
Okay.

860
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,794
How about a friendly contest?

861
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:41,327
No punching in the face,
two out of three.

862
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:43,854
Who puts who
on the ground first.

863
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,600
Nobody tries to hurt
nobody, just...

864
00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:48,552
who ends up on their butt.

865
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:54,883
That's a great idea, Kato.

866
00:47:07,106 --> 00:47:08,908
You know, Bruce,
that guy's kinda famous.

867
00:47:08,964 --> 00:47:10,233
That guy?

868
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:11,892
For what?

869
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,233
Killed his wife and
got away with it.

870
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,003
That guy?

871
00:47:16,371 --> 00:47:17,609
That guy.

872
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:43,633
Not bad, Kato.

873
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:46,180
Try that again.

874
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:29,272
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

875
00:48:29,935 --> 00:48:32,454
What the fuck is going on here?

876
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:35,303
Hey, jackass, this is our series lead.

877
00:48:35,367 --> 00:48:36,891
The fuck are you thinking?

878
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,689
You're right, Janet.
I'm sorry about that.

879
00:48:38,714 --> 00:48:41,770
Don't fucking Janet me, you prick.

880
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:44,164
Hey! What's up, babe?

881
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,610
"What's up", Randy
is that your loser asshole

882
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:49,564
wife-killing buddy boy here

883
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:51,381
was beating the
shit out of Bruce!

884
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:52,675
What?

885
00:48:52,923 --> 00:48:53,867
Hey, Randy.

886
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:54,842
Cliff!

887
00:48:54,938 --> 00:48:56,795
What the fuck, man?

888
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,171
Let me just say...

889
00:48:58,254 --> 00:49:00,191
nobody beat the
shit out of Bruce.

890
00:49:00,412 --> 00:49:02,571
It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.

891
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:05,741
I think that dent in the car
says somethin' different.

892
00:49:06,578 --> 00:49:09,196
Oh, my God!

893
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:11,869
What the fuck did
you do to my car?

894
00:49:12,066 --> 00:49:14,089
What the fuck did
you do to her car?

895
00:49:14,595 --> 00:49:16,031
I threw this little prick into it

896
00:49:16,056 --> 00:49:17,802
but I did not know
it was her car.

897
00:49:17,992 --> 00:49:19,595
Get the wardrobe off,

898
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,286
get your shit

899
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:22,556
and get fucked!

900
00:49:22,677 --> 00:49:23,725
- Janet!
- What?

901
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:25,152
I will handle this.

902
00:49:25,193 --> 00:49:27,000
Then, fucking handle it, Randy!

903
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:29,476
Cliff...

904
00:49:30,173 --> 00:49:31,657
get the wardrobe off,

905
00:49:31,729 --> 00:49:33,229
get your shit

906
00:49:33,546 --> 00:49:35,578
and get off the lot.

907
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:40,102

Oh, yeah, hey, man,
I'm looking for Terry.

00:50:42,847 --> 00:50:45,536
I'm a friend of Terry's

923
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,584
Well, Terry and Candy
don't live here anymore.

924
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:49,750
This is the Polanski

00:51:07,828 --> 00:51:09,426

Hey, Rick!

940
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:34,091
I know we just broke for lunch,

941
00:51:34,116 --> 00:51:36,886
but you need to wait at least
an hour before you can eat.

942
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:38,482
Give the glue a chance to dry.

943
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,550
No worries, honey.
I got my book.

944
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,751
Say, say...

945
00:51:42,822 --> 00:51:44,638
Where's the bad guy saloon?

946
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,857
You just go straight
to Western town,

947
00:51:46,882 --> 00:51:49,211
take a right and a left
and you'll see it right there.

948
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:50,473
Thanks, honey.

949
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:53,004
Hello.

950
00:52:56,015 --> 00:52:57,079
Hello.

951
00:52:59,501 --> 00:53:00,405
Hello.

952
00:53:04,669 --> 00:53:06,699
Bother you if
I sat next to you,

953
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:08,312
and read my book, too?

954
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:11,631
I don't know.

955
00:53:12,964 --> 00:53:14,483
Would you bother me?

956
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,824
I'll try not to.

957
00:53:20,037 --> 00:53:21,252
Sit.

958
00:54:08,283 --> 00:54:10,156
Sorry. Sorry 'bout that.

959
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,927
You don't eat lunch?

960
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:21,697
I've got a scene after lunch.

961
00:54:22,435 --> 00:54:23,641
Yeah?

962
00:54:24,934 --> 00:54:28,164
Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.

963
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:30,300
I believe it's the
job of an actor,

964
00:54:30,325 --> 00:54:32,571
and I say actor not actress

965
00:54:32,596 --> 00:54:35,371
because the word
actress is nonsensical.

966
00:54:35,435 --> 00:54:37,220
It's the actor's job

967
00:54:37,245 --> 00:54:39,955
to avoid impediments
to their performance.

968
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,489
It's the actor's job

969
00:54:41,514 --> 00:54:44,324
to strive for 100% effectiveness.

970
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:49,208
Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit

971
00:54:49,459 --> 00:54:51,498
that's meaningful.

972
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:53,518
Who are you?

973
00:54:53,543 --> 00:54:55,273
You can call me Mirabella.

974
00:54:55,331 --> 00:54:58,093
Mi-Mirabella what?

975
00:54:58,244 --> 00:54:59,791
Mirabella Lancer.

976
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:03,766
No, no, c-come on,
W-What's your real name?

977
00:55:05,254 --> 00:55:06,460
When we're on set,

978
00:55:06,485 --> 00:55:09,374
I prefer to only be referred
to by my character's name.

979
00:55:09,485 --> 00:55:12,278
It helps me immerse in
the reality of the story.

980
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:14,298
I've tried it both ways and I'm

981
00:55:14,337 --> 00:55:17,305
always just a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

982
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,418
If I can be a tiny bit better...

983
00:55:19,811 --> 00:55:21,470
I want to be.

984
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:27,277
You're the bad guy.
Caleb DeCoteau.

985
00:55:30,903 --> 00:55:34,601
Thought it was
pronounced Caleb DeCoteau.

986
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,248
I'm pretty sure it's DeCoteau.

987
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:42,052
- DeCoteau.
- Mm-hmm.

988
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:45,351
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

989
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:05,152
What are you reading?

990
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,661
It's a biography on Walt Disney.

991
00:56:08,975 --> 00:56:10,530
It's fascinating.

992
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:12,428
He's a genius, you know.

993
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,472
I mean, once in every 50
or 100 years kind of genius.

994
00:56:15,646 --> 00:56:17,869
Wh-What are you, twelve?

995
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,324
I'm eight.

996
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:22,690
What are you reading?

997
00:56:24,253 --> 00:56:25,689
Just a Western.

998
00:56:25,737 --> 00:56:28,411
What does that mean?
Is it good?

999
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,046
Pretty good.

1000
00:56:30,526 --> 00:56:32,169
What's the story?

1001
00:56:33,087 --> 00:56:34,913
Haven't finished it yet.

1002
00:56:35,095 --> 00:56:38,183
I didn't ask for the whole story.

1003
00:56:38,235 --> 00:56:40,537
What's the idea of the story?

1004
00:56:41,304 --> 00:56:46,733
Well... it's about, uh, this guy
who's a bronco buster.

1005
00:56:47,499 --> 00:56:49,856
It's a story of his life.

1006
00:56:50,717 --> 00:56:52,479
The guy's name is Tom Breezy

1007
00:56:52,504 --> 00:56:55,107
but everyone always
calls him Easy Breezy.

1008
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:59,739
Now, when Easy Breezy
was in his 20s and-and

1009
00:56:59,786 --> 00:57:01,886
young and good-lookin', he could

1010
00:57:01,911 --> 00:57:04,475
he could break any horse
that you can throw at him.

1011
00:57:04,753 --> 00:57:07,309
Back then, he just had a way.

1012
00:57:07,843 --> 00:57:10,129
Now, he's into his, uh,

1013
00:57:10,322 --> 00:57:13,968
late 30s and takes a bad fall
and messes up his hip

1014
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:18,048
He's not... crippled
or anything like that, but...

1015
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,031
but he's got spine problems

1016
00:57:21,403 --> 00:57:24,173
he's never had before
and he spends, uh,

1017
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:29,098
more of his days in pain than
he ever did before.

1018
00:57:29,191 --> 00:57:31,691
Jeepers, it sounds like a good novel.

1019
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:34,419
Yeah, it's not bad.

1020
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:37,427
Where are you in it?

1021
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:39,895
About midway.

1022
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:43,864
What's happening
to Easy Breezy now?

1023
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:46,813
Uh, he's, uh...

1024
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:50,036
He's not the best anymore.

1025
00:57:51,437 --> 00:57:53,397
In fact, far from it.

1026
00:57:55,376 --> 00:57:58,704
He's comin' to terms of what
it's like to be slightly more...

1027
00:58:02,035 --> 00:58:03,342
use...

1028
00:58:11,346 --> 00:58:13,052
Slightly more useless

1029
00:58:13,764 --> 00:58:15,168
each day.

1030
00:58:31,017 --> 00:58:32,803
I-It's okay, Caleb.

1031
00:58:32,914 --> 00:58:34,422
It's okay.

1032
00:58:34,815 --> 00:58:36,815
Sounds like a really sad book.

1033
00:58:37,236 --> 00:58:38,966
Poor Easy Breezy.

1034
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:42,549
I'm practically cryin'
and I haven't even read it.

1035
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:45,864
About 15 years,
you'll be livin' it.

1036
00:58:46,046 --> 00:58:47,260
What?

1037
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,023

You know somethin', you, uh...

1041
00:59:00,025 --> 00:59:02,208
you might be right
about this book.

1042
00:59:03,084 --> 00:59:05,870
I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.

1043
00:59:08,074 --> 00:59:11,392
I don't like names
like "pumpkinpuss"...

1044
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,011
but since you're upset...

1045
00:59:14,365 --> 00:59:16,666

Thanks so much.

- Well, good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

1060
01:00:41,645 --> 01:00:44,027
- Have a good time at Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

1061
01:00:44,076 --> 01:00:45,074
Take care.

1062
01:01:51,759 --> 01:01:52,981
Oh, hey.

1063
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:54,440
Hello.

1064
01:01:54,465 --> 01:01:56,791
How can I help you, young lady?

1065
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:01,255
I'm here to pick
up a first edition

1066
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,709
of Thomas Hardy's
<i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

1067
01:02:03,836 --> 01:02:05,177
It's under Polanski.

1068
01:02:05,204 --> 01:02:06,885
Yeah, you're talking
books here, kid.

1069
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:08,981
Oh, I know. Isn't it wonderful?

1070
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:10,723
- I just read it.
- Yeah?

1071
01:02:10,748 --> 01:02:12,818
I'm getting it as a
gift for my husband.

1072
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:18,139
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

1073
01:02:18,186 --> 01:02:19,519
Jim Stacy.

1074
01:02:19,544 --> 01:02:21,197
It's my show. Welcome aboard.

1075
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,208
We're real glad to have a pro like
you playing the heavy on the pilot.

1076
01:02:24,419 --> 01:02:25,792
And I gotta tell ya...

1077
01:02:25,822 --> 01:02:29,378
I came damn close to being in
The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey.

1078
01:02:29,627 --> 01:02:31,405
- No kiddin'?
- Yeah!

1079
01:02:32,718 --> 01:02:35,075
I just got my part for sheer luck.

1080
01:02:35,174 --> 01:02:38,571
Up until two weeks before
shootin', Fabian was in the part,

1081
01:02:38,686 --> 01:02:41,433
Th-Then he breaks his
shoulder doing The Virginian,

1082
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:42,656
that's how I got it, so.

1083
01:02:42,681 --> 01:02:43,838
Ah!

1084
01:02:45,268 --> 01:02:48,316
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
somethin' I heard about.

1085
01:02:49,117 --> 01:02:51,879
Was it true you almost got the
McQueen part in The Great Escape?

1086
01:02:53,734 --> 01:02:54,844
Hilts, isn't it?

1087
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:56,644
Captain Hilts, actually.

1088
01:02:56,836 --> 01:02:59,157
- 17 escape attempts.
- 18.

1089
01:02:59,182 --> 01:03:01,680
Never had an audition.
Never had a meetin'.

1090
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,178
N-Never met John Sturges.

1091
01:03:03,203 --> 01:03:05,555
So, no, I don't think
you could say I...

1092
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,150
I almost got the part.

1093
01:03:07,895 --> 01:03:09,333
Engineer?

1094
01:03:09,364 --> 01:03:10,389
Flyer.

1095
01:03:10,414 --> 01:03:12,578
I suppose you're what's
called in American Army...

1096
01:03:12,672 --> 01:03:13,981
a hotshot pilot.

1097
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:18,753
But, the story goes,
for a brief moment,

1098
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:22,127
McQueen almost
passed on the movie

1099
01:03:22,152 --> 01:03:23,292
and in that brief moment,

1100
01:03:23,317 --> 01:03:25,409
I-I apprently was
on the list of four.

1101
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,053
You have other plans?

1102
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:30,079
I haven't seen Berlin yet from
the ground or from the air

1103
01:03:30,104 --> 01:03:32,350
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

1104
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,492
You and who?

1105
01:03:33,545 --> 01:03:35,489
Me... and the three Georges.

1106
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:36,894
Which three Georges?

1107
01:03:36,919 --> 01:03:38,673
Peppard, Maharis, and Chakiris.

1108
01:03:38,698 --> 01:03:40,122
- Oh, man!
- Yeah.

1109
01:03:40,147 --> 01:03:41,443
That's gotta hurt.

1110
01:03:41,468 --> 01:03:43,546
Yeah, well, I didn't get it.

1111
01:03:43,943 --> 01:03:45,142
McQueen did it.

1112
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:47,921
And frankly,
I never had a chance.

1113
01:03:49,571 --> 01:03:51,468
Ten days isolation, Hilts.

1114
01:03:51,976 --> 01:03:53,357
Captain Hilts.

1115
01:03:53,541 --> 01:03:54,978
20 days.

1116
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:56,293
Right.

1117
01:03:57,421 --> 01:04:00,143
Oh, uh, you'll still be here
when I get out?

1118
01:04:01,678 --> 01:04:02,906
Cooler.

1119
01:04:58,378 --> 01:04:59,418
One, please.

1120
01:04:59,686 --> 01:05:01,233
75 cents.

1121
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,572
What if I'm in the movie?

1122
01:05:07,132 --> 01:05:08,354
What do you mean?

1123
01:05:08,473 --> 01:05:10,703
I mean, I'm in the movie.

1124
01:05:10,989 --> 01:05:12,537
I'm Sharon Tate.

1125
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,455
You're in this?

1126
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:17,606
Mm-hmm. I play Miss Carlson.
The klutz.

1127
01:05:18,659 --> 01:05:20,056
That's me.

1128
01:05:21,433 --> 01:05:24,076
But that's the girl from
Valley of the Dolls.

1129
01:05:25,658 --> 01:05:27,522
Well, that's me,

1130
01:05:27,547 --> 01:05:29,984
the girl from Valley of the Dolls.

1131
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:33,179
- Really?
- Really.

1132
01:05:35,626 --> 01:05:37,641
Hey, Ruben! Come out here.

1133
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:42,950
This is the girl from
Valley of the Dolls.

1134
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:46,263
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

1135
01:05:46,288 --> 01:05:48,333
- The girl from Peyton Place?
- No, the other one.

1136
01:05:48,405 --> 01:05:50,817
The one who ends up
doing dirty movies.

1137
01:05:51,212 --> 01:05:52,442
Oh...

1138
01:05:52,624 --> 01:05:53,607
She's in this movie.

1139
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,464
Oh.

1140
01:05:54,545 --> 01:05:55,712
Sharon Tate.

1141
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:57,046
Well...

1142
01:05:57,071 --> 01:05:59,256
Welcome to the Bruin, Miss Tate.

1143
01:05:59,281 --> 01:06:00,910
Thank you for coming
to our theater.

1144
01:06:01,096 --> 01:06:02,666
Would you like to come
in and see the show?

1145
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:03,728
Could I?

1146
01:06:03,786 --> 01:06:04,897
By all means.

1147
01:06:06,246 --> 01:06:07,318
Thank you.

1148
01:06:09,196 --> 01:06:11,252
Hey... can I get a picture?

1149
01:06:11,315 --> 01:06:12,553
Oh, sure!

1150
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,311
You know, why don't you
stand over by the poster?

1151
01:06:19,344 --> 01:06:21,153
So people will
know who you are.

1152
01:06:21,676 --> 01:06:22,764
Okay.

1153
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,364
Could you?

1154
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:38,288
Would you like
some refreshments?

1155
01:06:38,337 --> 01:06:40,673
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

1187
01:08:22,095 --> 01:08:23,024

1188
01:08:23,095 --> 01:08:25,794

01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:31,652
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

1192
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:34,208
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

1193
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:45,882
<i>Some kind of hotel
you got here.</i>

1194
01:08:48,188 --> 01:08:50,077
<i>Half a bottle's
better than none.</i>

1195
01:09:38,196 --> 01:09:40,059
That's far enough, jughead.

1196
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:42,946
Name's not jughead.

1197
01:09:43,941 --> 01:09:45,838
What you doin' 'round here, boy?

1198
01:09:46,112 --> 01:09:47,324
I'm thirsty.

1199
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:48,983
That's a saloon, ain't it?

1200
01:09:49,215 --> 01:09:50,501
Oh, yeah.

1201
01:09:50,544 --> 01:09:51,982
That's a saloon.

1202
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,740
Only you can't come in.

1203
01:09:53,765 --> 01:09:55,193
Mr. Gilbert.

1204
01:09:56,805 --> 01:10:00,135
Don't let me stop you
from earnin' your money.

1205
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:05,480
I know how bored and restless
you get when you run out of...

1206
01:10:05,536 --> 01:10:06,884
tamales.

1207
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:10,747
But Mr. Gilbert, if I was you...

1208
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:14,315
you'd find out that
jughead's name.

1209
01:10:15,891 --> 01:10:18,494
Allow me to introduce
the two of ya.

1210
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:22,592
This here is Bob Gilbert.

1211
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:25,283
The businessman?

1212
01:10:25,488 --> 01:10:26,734
That's right.

1213
01:10:27,131 --> 01:10:29,083
Business Bob Gilbert.

1214
01:10:29,954 --> 01:10:31,557
Who might he be, Caleb?

1215
01:10:31,787 --> 01:10:34,311
Oh, that's a fella
by the name of Madrid.

1216
01:10:35,562 --> 01:10:36,943
Johnny Madrid.

1217
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,319
Who's Johnny Madrid?

1218
01:10:46,177 --> 01:10:48,074
He ain't from 'round here.

1219
01:10:48,232 --> 01:10:49,701
No, really.

1220
01:10:50,256 --> 01:10:51,629
Who is he, Caleb?

1221
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:57,681
Well, you're about to find out.

1222
01:10:59,552 --> 01:11:00,949
Businessman.

1223
01:11:18,255 --> 01:11:20,142
Ready when you are,

1224
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,437
Gilbert.

1225
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,810
Again, mas?

1226
01:12:03,339 --> 01:12:04,974
Johnny Madrid.

1227
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,075
How long's it been?

1228
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,583
Since that time in Juarez, 'bout...

1229
01:12:14,758 --> 01:12:16,123
three years ago.

1230
01:12:16,474 --> 01:12:18,363
Come on in, have a drink.

1231
01:12:19,294 --> 01:12:21,913
Hell, in that case...

1232
01:12:23,683 --> 01:12:25,159
buy you a drink, Caleb?

1233
01:12:26,328 --> 01:12:27,764
Sure, Johnny.

1234
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:31,019
How 'bout some mezcal?

1235
01:12:31,324 --> 01:12:33,459
Like that time in Juarez.

1236
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:36,757
A lot of people died that day.

1237
01:12:37,781 --> 01:12:39,083
Yes, they did.

1238
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:42,176
But we had a good time.

1239
01:12:42,953 --> 01:12:44,016
Didn't we?

1240
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:45,144
Yeah.

1241
01:12:45,223 --> 01:12:46,374
We did.

1242
01:12:47,289 --> 01:12:49,154
After you, DeCoteau.

1243
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:51,507
Pepe!

1244
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:54,744
Get your behind behind that
bar, I have a guest.

1245
01:13:03,287 --> 01:13:04,501
Dos mezcal.

1246
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:09,308
<i>You have food?</i>

1247
01:13:09,771 --> 01:13:11,303
<i>Beans and tortillas.</i>

1248
01:13:11,366 --> 01:13:12,620
How's some beans?

1249
01:13:14,188 --> 01:13:15,370
I've had worse.

1250
01:13:15,698 --> 01:13:17,753
<i>Give us a plate of beans.</i>

1251
01:13:18,118 --> 01:13:19,357
One dollar.

1252
01:13:22,809 --> 01:13:25,531
To my wife
and all my sweethearts...

1253
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,476
may they never meet.

1254
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,231
Señor Madrid.

1255
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:39,073
Would you care to
join me at my table

1256
01:13:39,098 --> 01:13:40,610
where I entertain my guests?

1257
01:13:40,635 --> 01:13:42,802
I'd be delighted,
Monsieur DeCoteau.

1258
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:46,462
Take the bottle wit' ya.

1259
01:13:48,641 --> 01:13:50,014
So Johnny.

1260
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:54,577
What brings you
to Royal Del Hole?

1261
01:13:54,608 --> 01:13:56,496
Oh, you know me, Caleb.

1262
01:13:57,306 --> 01:13:58,393
The money.

1263
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,845
And who's paying around here?

1264
01:14:02,364 --> 01:14:03,554
I hope you.

1265
01:14:06,046 --> 01:14:07,886
And what have you
heard about me?

1266
01:14:08,556 --> 01:14:10,342
I heard about
the Lancer Ranch,

1267
01:14:10,523 --> 01:14:12,356
all the cattle
you've appropriated.

1268
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:14,827
A lotta land, lotta
cows, a lotta money,

1269
01:14:14,852 --> 01:14:15,993
no law to speak of,

1270
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:17,464
and nothin' but an
old man and some

1271
01:14:17,489 --> 01:14:19,758
Mexican ranch hands
to shoo ya off.

1272
01:14:22,806 --> 01:14:23,767
Hey...

1273
01:14:23,944 --> 01:14:27,070
where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours' fiddle?

1274
01:14:27,817 --> 01:14:28,992
She's asleep.

1275
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:31,082
Wake her the heck up,
get her down here

1276
01:14:31,131 --> 01:14:34,726
with her fiddle and her bow
and entertain my guest.

1277
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,526
Si, señor.

1278
01:14:37,965 --> 01:14:40,425
But please,
don't hurt her this time.

1279
01:14:41,889 --> 01:14:43,532
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1280
01:14:44,215 --> 01:14:46,620
I just want her to play the fiddle.

1281
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:51,603
Line?

1282
01:14:51,628 --> 01:14:53,674
Go... go fetch her and tell her what?

1283
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,786
Go fetch her and tell
her I'll give her

1284
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:57,398
a fat five-dollar gold piece...

1285
01:14:57,423 --> 01:14:59,074
Right, right, go fetch her
and tell her I'll give her a fat

1286
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:01,074
fat five-
fat five-dollar gold piece

1287
01:15:01,099 --> 01:15:03,255
if she played her little chili
pepper heart out, right?

1288
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,239
- Right.
- Yeah.

1289
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,216
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1290
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,867
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

1291
01:15:15,059 --> 01:15:16,281
Now, go fetch her and tell her

1292
01:15:16,338 --> 01:15:18,424
I'll give her a fat
five-dollar gold piece

1293
01:15:18,449 --> 01:15:20,808
if she played her little
chili pepper heart out.

1294
01:15:21,525 --> 01:15:22,589
Go on!

1295
01:15:27,613 --> 01:15:29,383
So, Johnny.

1296
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:33,025
What else you heard, hmm?

1297
01:15:33,735 --> 01:15:35,926
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard

1298
01:15:36,227 --> 01:15:39,446
but Lancer's got money.

1299
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:41,906
At some point,

1300
01:15:42,322 --> 01:15:44,473
he's gonna hire some guns

1301
01:15:44,764 --> 01:15:46,835
and push back.

1302
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,422
Line? Line, line, line...

1303
01:15:55,481 --> 01:15:56,695
Maybe he already has.

1304
01:15:59,878 --> 01:16:00,926
Maybe...

1305
01:16:01,053 --> 01:16:03,355
Goddammit!
I fucked this whole thing up!

1306
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:05,424
Damn, I fucked
this whole thing up.

1307
01:16:05,497 --> 01:16:06,614
Just go back, please.

1308
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:07,954
Could we just cut?
Could we just cut?

1309
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:10,994
- No, really, just say the fucking line!
- No, Sam, please.

1310
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:13,449
"Maybe he already has"
"Maybe he already has"

1311
01:16:13,474 --> 01:16:15,966
Argh! Goddammit!
Alright! Alright! Alright!

1312
01:16:16,129 --> 01:16:17,486
Whoo!

1313
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,795
Goddamn outlaw, Rick.
Come on now.

1314
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,381
Hoo!

1315
01:16:21,691 --> 01:16:23,643
I got it. I got it.

1316
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:25,686
Go back a bit, would you?

1317
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,695
No, he's right. Back to one.

1318
01:16:29,095 --> 01:16:31,809
- Use all that anger, use it.
- Oh, I'ma use it.

1319
01:16:31,893 --> 01:16:34,117
- You show me tough.
- Mm-hmm.

1320
01:16:36,614 --> 01:16:39,534
And... action.

1321
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:44,718
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard.

1322
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:47,921
But Lancer's got money.

1323
01:16:48,756 --> 01:16:50,058
At some point,

1324
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,101
he's gonna hire some guns...

1325
01:16:54,156 --> 01:16:55,528
and push back.

1326
01:16:58,772 --> 01:17:00,859
Maybe he already has.

1327
01:17:02,653 --> 01:17:03,684
Maybe.

1328
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:08,463
Maybe I don't like Lancer.

1329
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:11,849
Maybe I don't like his boots.

1330
01:17:13,438 --> 01:17:16,325
Maybe I don't like the
way he uses those boots

1331
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:17,922
to step on people.

1332
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,745
What the fuck was that?!

1333
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,703
Jesus Christ!

1334
01:17:26,076 --> 01:17:27,092
Fuck!

1335
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:28,870
Shit.

1336
01:17:30,118 --> 01:17:31,769
Damn it, Rick, you screwed up

1337
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,588
the fucking lines!

1338
01:17:33,613 --> 01:17:36,612
Embarrass yourself like that in
front of all those goddamn people!

1339
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,306
You're drinkin' all night.

1340
01:17:38,371 --> 01:17:40,786
Fuckin' drinkin' again,
eight goddamn

1341
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:42,563
fuckin' whiskey sours.

1342
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:46,246
Fuckin' bullshit.

1343
01:17:47,672 --> 01:17:50,188
You're a fuckin' miserable drunk.

1344
01:17:50,228 --> 01:17:52,720
Fuckin' remember your fuckin' lines.

1345
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,189
I practiced 'em!

1346
01:17:54,214 --> 01:17:56,253
And now I don't look like
I goddamn practiced 'em!

1347
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:58,153
You're sittin' there
like a fuckin' baboon...

1348
01:17:58,178 --> 01:17:58,943
Blah-blah-blah...

1349
01:17:58,991 --> 01:17:59,887
Duh-duh-duh...

1350
01:17:59,929 --> 01:18:01,377
Duh-duh-duh-duh. Fuck!

1351
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:02,370
Eight fuckin' whiskey sours.

1352
01:18:02,435 --> 01:18:05,253
I couldn't stop at fuckin'
three or four, I have eight?!

1353
01:18:05,308 --> 01:18:06,339
Why?

1354
01:18:06,388 --> 01:18:09,134
You're a fuckin' alcoholic,
I drink too much!

1355
01:18:09,234 --> 01:18:11,782
Every fuckin' night!
Every fuckin' night!

1356
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:13,917
That's it, that's fuckin' it!

1357
01:18:14,002 --> 01:18:15,334
That's fuckin' it.

1358
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:17,367
You stop drinkin' right now, alright?

1359
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,892
Make a promise to yourself
you'll stop fuckin' drinkin'.

1360
01:18:25,374 --> 01:18:26,564
Dammit!

1361
01:18:27,472 --> 01:18:29,373
You gonna show
that fucking crew.

1362
01:18:29,398 --> 01:18:31,533
You gonna show that
goddamn Jim Stacy.

1363
01:18:31,572 --> 01:18:33,817
You gonna show all them
on that goddamn fuckin' set

1364
01:18:33,889 --> 01:18:36,198
who the fuck Rick Dalton is, alright?

1365
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,085
Lemme tell you somethin'...

1366
01:18:38,142 --> 01:18:40,427
you don't get these lines right...

1367
01:18:40,866 --> 01:18:43,628
I'ma blow your fuckin'
brains out tonight.

1368
01:18:43,922 --> 01:18:44,945
Alright?

1369
01:18:45,025 --> 01:18:48,644
Your brains are gonna be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

1370
01:18:48,669 --> 01:18:50,324
I mean it, motherfucker.

1371
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,197
Get your shit together.

1372
01:19:57,773 --> 01:19:59,304

I'm going to Chatsworth.

Chatsworth?

1421
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:30,184
You hitch up and down

1422
01:22:30,271 --> 01:22:32,462

dive you to Chatsworth?

1423

I'm their favorite part of their
L.A. vacation, you know.

1425
01:22:36,823 --> 01:22:38,504
They'll be telling stories about

1426
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:40,426
a Hollywood hippie girl

1427
01:22:40,474 --> 01:22:42,617

No.

I know where it is.

1449
01:23:27,975 --> 01:23:29,912
Are you some
old cowboy guy that

1450
01:23:29,948 --> 01:23:31,067
used to make movies there?

1451
01:23:31,111 --> 01:23:32,182

What?

1453
01:23:35,077 --> 01:23:37,783
Surprised how accurate that
description of me really is.

1454
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:41,311
Some old cowboy guy who used
to shoot movies at Spahn Ranch.

1455
01:23:42,043 --> 01:23:43,376
You used to...

1456
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:46,773
make Westerns at the ranch
back in the old-timey days?

1457
01:23:49,212 --> 01:23:51,950
Well, if by the old-timey days

1458
01:23:51,975 --> 01:23:54,046
you mean television
eight years ago...

1459
01:23:54,097 --> 01:23:55,279
yeah.

1460
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:56,811
You an actor?

1461
01:23:56,889 --> 01:23:58,516
No, I'm a stuntman.

1462
01:23:59,674 --> 01:24:00,975
Stuntman.

1463
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:03,840
That's way better.

1464
01:24:04,708 --> 01:24:06,399
Why is that way better?

1465
01:24:07,287 --> 01:24:08,631
Actors are phony.

1466
01:24:08,656 --> 01:24:09,621
Oh.

1467
01:24:09,646 --> 01:24:11,266
They just say lines
that other people write

1468
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,195
and pretend to murder
people on their...

01:24:15,689 --> 01:24:17,832

01:25:37,051 --> 01:25:38,090
Yeah.

1500
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:44,137

1501
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:46,042

1502
01:25:47,214 --> 01:25:49,468

you are too old to fuck me.

1507
01:26:00,565 --> 01:26:02,208

1522
01:27:48,482 --> 01:27:50,085
The one from Boston.

1523
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:52,463
Don't know.

1524
01:27:52,923 --> 01:27:54,225

1528

1530
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,378

1532
01:28:20,134 --> 01:28:22,389

1534
01:28:25,242 --> 01:28:27,725

1546
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:01,285

1547
01:29:01,994 --> 01:29:03,502
Bengal Lancers.

1548
01:29:07,365 --> 01:29:09,841
Now, now, now, now, that is funny.
That is funny.

1549
01:29:09,905 --> 01:29:11,706

1551
01:29:13,346 --> 01:29:16,395
Bengal... Lancer. Hmm?

1552
01:29:16,667 --> 01:29:17,905
Oh, yeah.

1553
01:29:20,092 --> 01:29:22,179
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

1554
01:29:23,246 --> 01:29:26,238
You do know kidnapping
is a hanging offense.

1555
01:29:26,637 --> 01:29:29,000
So is blowin' the
heads off little girls.

1556
01:29:31,118 --> 01:29:33,245

1557

Right?

1558
01:29:34,978 --> 01:29:36,267
So...

1559
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:41,214
You come down here for a...
for a Boston social?

1560
01:29:41,457 --> 01:29:43,266

mole in Mexico.

1565
01:29:52,157 --> 01:29:53,181

1568
01:29:58,366 --> 01:29:59,612
I agree.

1569
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:02,671

1570
01:30:03,143 --> 01:30:05,477
Well, I'll send one of
my boys out to your ranch

1571

01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:13,769

01:30:14,647 --> 01:30:17,774
I don't want no

01:30:17,838 --> 01:30:19,258
handin' me that $50,000,

1575
01:30:19,325 --> 01:30:22,682
I want the old man himself...

1576
01:30:22,837 --> 01:30:24,392
Murdoch Lancer

1577
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:27,704
puts $50,000 in my lap!

1578
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:31,361
Or I'll heave this little
pitcher down the well!

1579
01:30:31,864 --> 01:30:34,396
You got that, Boston?!

1580
01:30:34,761 --> 01:30:35,825
Ha?!

1581
01:30:36,356 --> 01:30:37,388
Yeah.

1582
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:40,710
Alright, messenger boy...

1583
01:30:41,638 --> 01:30:43,106
deliver my message.

1584
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:53,216
Give me evil, sexy Hamlet...

1585
01:30:53,617 --> 01:30:55,196
Settle into it...

1586
01:30:55,537 --> 01:30:57,037
Enjoy it...

1587
01:30:57,617 --> 01:30:59,029
And cut!

1588
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:02,651
Oh, boy.

1589
01:31:02,845 --> 01:31:05,400
I didn't hurt you there,
Mirabella, with that throw, did I?

1590
01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:08,323
No, no, no, I'm good.
I've got pads on.

1591
01:31:08,366 --> 01:31:11,342
I always throw myself on the
floor, just for fun,

1592
01:31:11,367 --> 01:31:12,938
even when I'm not getting paid.

1593
01:31:13,866 --> 01:31:15,064
Next plate.

1594
01:31:15,159 --> 01:31:18,945
Rick, Rick, Rick! Put her there!

1595
01:31:18,970 --> 01:31:20,234
- Oh.
- That was it!

1596
01:31:20,333 --> 01:31:22,936
That was absolutely fantastic.
I loved it!

1597
01:31:23,161 --> 01:31:24,598
Hey, and your idea about

1598
01:31:24,638 --> 01:31:26,160
throwing the little
girl on the ground,

1599
01:31:26,185 --> 01:31:27,566
that just worked like a charm.

1600
01:31:28,064 --> 01:31:30,295
- You said Shakespeare.
- Oh, that's right!

1601
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:33,070
And that's what I
mean by 'scare me'.

1602
01:31:33,095 --> 01:31:33,800
Yeah.

1603
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,553
Evil Hamlet scares people!

1604
01:31:35,578 --> 01:31:36,297
All right.

1605
01:31:36,322 --> 01:31:38,046
Oh, and by the way...

1606
01:31:38,129 --> 01:31:40,264
"beaner bronco buster"?

1607
01:31:40,293 --> 01:31:41,800
Where the hell did
that come from?

1608
01:31:41,825 --> 01:31:43,039
Improv.

1609
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:44,271
It's wonderful.

1610
01:31:44,805 --> 01:31:47,289
It's a triple alliterative improv.

1611
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:49,374
Don't get those too often.

1612
01:31:49,437 --> 01:31:51,136
- Okay! We're all good!
- All right.

1613
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:52,667
- Don't need to go again?
- No, we're done.

1614
01:31:52,692 --> 01:31:53,929
That was fantastic!

1615
01:31:53,999 --> 01:31:56,531
Okay, we're moving on.
We're in the bordello.

1616
01:31:56,668 --> 01:31:57,644
Next set up.

1617
01:32:01,658 --> 01:32:05,436
That was the best acting
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1618
01:32:06,924 --> 01:32:08,178
Thank you.

1619
01:32:26,155 --> 01:32:28,124
Rick fucking Dalton.

1620
01:32:41,064 --> 01:32:42,135
That's a car.

1621
01:32:43,575 --> 01:32:45,107
That's a strange car.

1622
01:32:46,452 --> 01:32:48,285
Snake, go see who's outside.

1623
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:02,282
So, who is it?

1624
01:33:02,746 --> 01:33:04,015
I ain't sure yet.

1625
01:33:04,859 --> 01:33:06,557
Bitchin' yellow Coupe de Ville.

1626
01:33:07,566 --> 01:33:08,947
Keep an eye on it.

1627
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:59,121
Come on.

1628
01:34:16,036 --> 01:34:17,536
Where the hell is everybody?

1629
01:34:27,201 --> 01:34:28,534
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1630
01:34:28,971 --> 01:34:30,542
She's down by the chop shop.

1631
01:34:37,226 --> 01:34:39,179
- Hey!
- Hello!

1632
01:34:39,313 --> 01:34:42,250
Gypsy, I want you to
come meet my new friend.

1633
01:34:42,976 --> 01:34:44,673
Some old lookin' dude
on a Hawaiian shirt

1634
01:34:44,698 --> 01:34:46,849
who just gave
Pussycat a ride home.

1635
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:48,452
He just give her a lift?

1636
01:34:48,839 --> 01:34:49,776
Nope.

1637
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:52,331
She's bringing him down the
ranch to meet everybody.

1638
01:34:52,748 --> 01:34:54,042
Stay by the door,

1639
01:34:54,067 --> 01:34:55,605
tell me if he starts
comin' this way.

1640
01:34:57,411 --> 01:34:59,768
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

1641
01:34:59,907 --> 01:35:02,304
And thank you for giving our
precious Pussy a ride home.

1642
01:35:02,368 --> 01:35:03,574
Think nothin' of it.

1643
01:35:03,867 --> 01:35:05,097
We love Pussy.

1644
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:06,888
Yes, we do.

1645
01:35:07,138 --> 01:35:09,082
Where is everybody?
Where's the children?

1646
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:10,884
Everybody left for Santa Barbara.

1647
01:35:11,747 --> 01:35:12,755
Really?

1648
01:35:13,454 --> 01:35:15,057
Charlie's gone? Everybody left?

1649
01:35:15,424 --> 01:35:18,503
Well, not everybody everybody
but mostly everybody.

1650
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:22,614
Dag.

1651
01:35:23,709 --> 01:35:25,645
I really wanted Cliff
to meet Charlie.

1652
01:35:26,714 --> 01:35:28,825
I think Charlie's
really gonna dig ya.

1653
01:35:28,952 --> 01:35:30,619
- Hey, Delilah.
- Well, maybe next time.

1654
01:35:31,327 --> 01:35:32,525
Yeah, you gotta come back.

1655
01:35:34,172 --> 01:35:36,490
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure would.

1656
01:35:37,604 --> 01:35:40,263
How's it all comparing
to your glory days?

1657
01:35:40,712 --> 01:35:42,339
Well, things have changed.

1658
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:47,831
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1659
01:35:47,991 --> 01:35:50,237
I used to ride horses
every day back in Tennessee.

1660
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,311
- Is that right?
- Every day?

1661
01:35:52,431 --> 01:35:53,526
Well, every week.

1662
01:35:54,638 --> 01:35:55,551
All right.

1663
01:35:56,332 --> 01:35:57,634
She's a darlin'.

1664
01:36:01,925 --> 01:36:04,639
So... my name is Lulu.

1665
01:36:04,877 --> 01:36:06,163
This is Tex.

1666
01:36:06,541 --> 01:36:08,785
We're gonna be leading
you on a great trail ride

1667
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:10,834
to the beautiful
Santa Susana canyon.

1668
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:12,745
Now, uh...

1669
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,966
Curt, I hear you're already
an experienced rider.

1670
01:36:14,991 --> 01:36:15,983
Yes.

1671
01:36:16,036 --> 01:36:18,241
- Yeah, and so are you, Connie?
- Yes, I am.

1672
01:36:18,266 --> 01:36:19,536
Tex, come here.

1673
01:36:19,651 --> 01:36:20,778
So, uh...

1674
01:36:20,849 --> 01:36:23,309
you're both experienced
riders, I guess, uh...

1675
01:36:23,334 --> 01:36:25,266
we'll just make this
ride about having fun!

1676
01:36:25,307 --> 01:36:26,718
Ready to have some fun?

1677
01:36:26,743 --> 01:36:29,418
So, uh, Pussycat brought
back some guy with her.

1678
01:36:29,558 --> 01:36:31,518
Gypsy wants you to go
give him a looksee.

1679
01:36:31,629 --> 01:36:33,113
Yeah, sure thing.

1680
01:36:52,109 --> 01:36:54,712
Oh, and here's someone
you actually have to meet.

1681
01:36:55,278 --> 01:36:57,810
One of our most favorite sons.

1682
01:36:57,874 --> 01:37:00,175
Tex, come over here
and say hi to Cliff.

1683
01:37:00,721 --> 01:37:02,625
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

1684
01:37:02,984 --> 01:37:04,507
What part of Texas you from?

1685
01:37:04,532 --> 01:37:06,230
Uh, place you never heard of.

1686
01:37:06,491 --> 01:37:07,689
Copeville.

1687
01:37:08,396 --> 01:37:09,682
Ever been to Houston?

1688
01:37:09,731 --> 01:37:10,842
'Course I have.

1689
01:37:10,969 --> 01:37:13,842
Yeah, spent two weeks once
on a Houston chain gang

1690
01:37:13,919 --> 01:37:15,483
in August, no less.

1691
01:37:15,592 --> 01:37:17,873
That don't sound
like a whole lotta fun.

1692
01:37:18,538 --> 01:37:20,364
It's the last cop's
jaw I ever broke

1693
01:37:20,389 --> 01:37:21,658
I can tell ya that.

1694
01:37:25,537 --> 01:37:26,537
Man.

1695
01:37:27,923 --> 01:37:29,423
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1696
01:37:30,382 --> 01:37:32,414
The Hawaiian guy
seems to be okay.

1697
01:37:32,725 --> 01:37:34,598
Everybody's talkin' all friendly.

1698
01:37:38,595 --> 01:37:40,794
Tex checked him out
and now he's riding away.

1699
01:37:41,673 --> 01:37:43,744
He comes this way, let me know.

1700
01:37:46,233 --> 01:37:49,114
Hey, does George Spahn
still own this ranch?

1701
01:37:49,328 --> 01:37:51,193
Yeah, George still owns it.

1702
01:37:51,665 --> 01:37:53,062
Does he still live here?

1703
01:37:53,228 --> 01:37:54,284
Yeah.

1704
01:37:54,393 --> 01:37:57,075
Does he still live...
right there?

1705
01:37:57,226 --> 01:37:58,234
Yeah.

1706
01:37:58,385 --> 01:37:59,718
Is he here now?

1707
01:38:00,254 --> 01:38:01,706
I guess so.

1708
01:38:03,322 --> 01:38:06,099
So, George gave you all
permission to be here.

1709
01:38:07,238 --> 01:38:08,349
'Course he did.

1710
01:38:08,445 --> 01:38:10,246
And you all take care of him.

1711
01:38:11,108 --> 01:38:12,648
Oh, we take care of George.

1712
01:38:13,409 --> 01:38:14,679
We love George.

1713
01:38:16,789 --> 01:38:18,440
Well, is there anything wrong

1714
01:38:18,519 --> 01:38:20,932
with me saying hello
to an old friend?

1715
01:38:20,992 --> 01:38:22,849
You can't see him right now.

1716
01:38:22,905 --> 01:38:24,913
Why can't I see him right now?

1717
01:38:26,544 --> 01:38:27,774
'Cause he's napping.

1718
01:38:29,997 --> 01:38:31,600
This is his naptime.

1719
01:38:41,496 --> 01:38:44,369
Well, I think I'll just go
see for myself.

1720
01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:46,822
You never know.

1721
01:38:47,238 --> 01:38:49,309
He mighta just woke up.

1722
01:38:58,819 --> 01:39:00,938
The Hawaiian guy's
coming this way.

1723
01:39:01,819 --> 01:39:03,668
Okay, ya'll, beat it.

1724
01:39:03,879 --> 01:39:05,133
I'll handle this guy.

Can I help you?

1736
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:01,459
I hope so.

1737
01:40:01,499 --> 01:40:04,571
I'm an old friend of George's,
thought I'd stop and say hello.

1738
01:40:04,596 --> 01:40:05,692
Well, that's very nice of you,

1739
01:40:05,717 --> 01:40:07,895
but unfortunately,
you picked the wrong time.

1740
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:09,651
George is taking a nap right now.

1741
01:40:09,968 --> 01:40:11,670
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1742
01:40:12,039 --> 01:40:13,495
Yes, it is.

1743
01:40:14,507 --> 01:40:15,931
What's your name?

1744
01:40:15,956 --> 01:40:17,379
Cliff Booth.

1745
01:40:17,627 --> 01:40:18,726
How do you know George?

1746
01:40:18,751 --> 01:40:21,095
I used to shoot Westerns
here at the ranch.

1747
01:40:21,261 --> 01:40:23,245
When was the last
time you saw George?

1748
01:40:23,414 --> 01:40:26,876
Oh, I'd say about...

1749
01:40:27,471 --> 01:40:29,217
eight years ago.

1750
01:40:30,282 --> 01:40:31,264
Oh.

1751
01:40:31,839 --> 01:40:34,488
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
the two of you were so close.

1752
01:40:35,698 --> 01:40:38,099
Well, when he wakes up,
I'll let him know you came by.

1753
01:40:38,617 --> 01:40:42,467
I'd really like to say a quick hello now,
while I'm here.

1754
01:40:42,519 --> 01:40:44,111
Came a long ways.

1755
01:40:44,136 --> 01:40:46,775
Don't know when I'll
get back this way again.

1756
01:40:47,328 --> 01:40:50,185
Oh, I understand but
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1757
01:40:50,688 --> 01:40:51,998
Impossible.

1758
01:40:52,335 --> 01:40:54,200
Why is that impossible?

1759
01:40:54,312 --> 01:40:56,553
Because me and George like
to watch TV on Sunday nights.

1760
01:40:56,578 --> 01:40:57,804
FBI and Bonanza

1761
01:40:57,829 --> 01:40:59,418
but George finds it hard
to keep awake that late

1762
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:00,623
so I make him take
a nap around now

1763
01:41:00,648 --> 01:41:02,672
so I don't get tripped out
of my George's TV time.

1764
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:07,287
Well, look, red,

1765
01:41:07,312 --> 01:41:09,053
I'm comin' in there.

1766
01:41:09,322 --> 01:41:10,745
With my own two eyes,

1767
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:13,054
I'm gonna get a
good look at George.

1768
01:41:14,274 --> 01:41:15,904
And this...

1769
01:41:17,401 --> 01:41:18,929
ain't stoppin' me.

1770
01:41:22,372 --> 01:41:23,563
Okay.

1771
01:41:24,654 --> 01:41:25,944
Suit yourself.

1772
01:41:38,047 --> 01:41:39,483
<i>You never know.</i>

1773
01:41:41,324 --> 01:41:43,562
<i>The next boy you meet
may be the one.</i>

1774
01:42:16,621 --> 01:42:19,502
<i>So clean, it's actually
good for your skin.</i>

1775
01:42:19,794 --> 01:42:21,571
<i>So fresh and natural looking,</i>

1776
01:42:21,683 --> 01:42:23,467
<i>you're always ready for next time.</i>

1777
01:42:24,567 --> 01:42:26,123
<i>And you never know,</i>

1778
01:42:26,475 --> 01:42:28,856
<i>the next boy you meet
may be the one.</i>

1779
01:42:37,001 --> 01:42:38,663
<i>Sparkling drop of Retsyn.</i>

1780
01:42:52,058 --> 01:42:53,546
He back there?

1781
01:42:55,105 --> 01:42:57,009
Door at the end of the hallway.

1782
01:42:58,177 --> 01:42:59,407
You might have to
shake him awake,

1783
01:42:59,455 --> 01:43:01,431
I fucked his brains
out this morning.

1784
01:43:06,975 --> 01:43:08,701
He may be tired.

1785
01:43:20,588 --> 01:43:22,715
Oh, Mister Eight-Years-Ago...

1786
01:43:24,045 --> 01:43:25,617
George is blind.

1787
01:43:25,642 --> 01:43:27,944
So you'll probably have to
tell him who you are.

1788
01:43:53,868 --> 01:43:55,505
George, you awake?

1789
01:44:13,511 --> 01:44:14,780
George?

1790
01:44:16,807 --> 01:44:17,948
George?

1791
01:44:21,868 --> 01:44:22,999
George?

1792
01:44:25,664 --> 01:44:26,993
George!

1793
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:29,413
Hi, George.

1794
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:32,920
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

1795
01:44:32,945 --> 01:44:34,751
I'm sorry to disturb you.

1796
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:36,729
Who are you?

1797
01:44:36,798 --> 01:44:38,088
It's Cliff Booth.

1798
01:44:38,205 --> 01:44:41,369
Just stopped in to say hello
and see how you're doin'.

1799
01:44:41,419 --> 01:44:43,086
John Wilkes Booth?

1800
01:44:43,165 --> 01:44:44,475
Cliff Booth.

1801
01:44:46,682 --> 01:44:47,952
Who's that?

1802
01:44:48,101 --> 01:44:50,690
I-I used to shoot
Bounty Law here, George.

1803
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,528
I was Rick Dalton's stunt double.

1804
01:44:52,955 --> 01:44:54,011
Who?

1805
01:44:54,036 --> 01:44:55,236
Rick Dalton.

1806
01:44:55,745 --> 01:44:57,461
The Dalton brothers...?

1807
01:44:57,501 --> 01:44:58,830
Rick Dalton.

1808
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:01,913
Who's that?

1809
01:45:01,938 --> 01:45:04,021
He was the star of Bounty Law.

1810
01:45:04,904 --> 01:45:06,253
Who are you?

1811
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:08,356
I was Rick's stunt double.

1812
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:11,206
Rick... who?

1813
01:45:11,385 --> 01:45:13,091
It don't matter, George.

1814
01:45:13,302 --> 01:45:16,382
We were colleagues from the past
and I just wanted to...

1815
01:45:16,407 --> 01:45:18,550
make sure you're doin' okay.

1816
01:45:18,575 --> 01:45:19,948
I'm not doin' okay.

1817
01:45:19,973 --> 01:45:21,010
What's the matter?

1818
01:45:21,035 --> 01:45:22,463
Can't see shit!

1819
01:45:22,808 --> 01:45:24,356
Would you call that "the matter"?

1820
01:45:24,428 --> 01:45:26,109
The man can't see shit, okay?

1821
01:45:26,134 --> 01:45:27,553
I'm sorry about that.

1822
01:45:27,578 --> 01:45:30,864
I was told...
Squeaky sent me to bed.

1823
01:45:31,558 --> 01:45:34,108
Would that be the little
redhead out front?

1824
01:45:36,714 --> 01:45:38,867
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

1825
01:45:39,403 --> 01:45:40,881
First, you wake me up,

1826
01:45:40,906 --> 01:45:43,326
and now you're pretending
that I didn't tell you

1827
01:45:43,351 --> 01:45:45,445
I was fucking blind!

1828
01:45:45,524 --> 01:45:47,012
How am I gonna know

1829
01:45:47,046 --> 01:45:49,992
what the hell color
the head of the girl is

1830
01:45:50,017 --> 01:45:51,597
that's with me all the time?

1831
01:45:51,622 --> 01:45:53,398
Oh, fair enough, George.

1832
01:45:57,036 --> 01:45:59,060
No, it's all right.

1833
01:46:00,288 --> 01:46:03,115
Everyone don't need a stuntman.

1834
01:46:10,379 --> 01:46:12,393
I don't know who you are...

1835
01:46:14,417 --> 01:46:16,669
but you touched me today.

1836
01:46:18,511 --> 01:46:20,738
You came to visit me.

1837
01:46:21,150 --> 01:46:23,243
Now I gotta go back to sleep.

1838
01:46:25,777 --> 01:46:28,272
I gotta watch FBI tonight.

1839
01:46:28,297 --> 01:46:30,420
And I watch it with Squeaky.

1840
01:46:31,137 --> 01:46:34,113
She gets all pissed off
if I fall asleep.

1841
01:46:35,212 --> 01:46:38,148
What happens if
she gets pissed off, George?

1842
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,559
Nothin'.

1843
01:46:41,928 --> 01:46:44,368
I just don't like
to disappoint her.

1844
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:52,662
So, you gave all these
hippies permission to be here?

1845
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:00,820
Just who the fuck are you?

1846
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:02,655
I'm Cliff Booth.

1847
01:47:02,893 --> 01:47:04,197
I'm your stuntman.

1848
01:47:04,222 --> 01:47:06,266
We used to work
together, George.

1849
01:47:06,544 --> 01:47:08,984
I just wanna make
sure that you're okay.

1850
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:12,424
That all these hippies aren't
taking advantage of ya.

1851
01:47:13,158 --> 01:47:15,281
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

1852
01:47:16,052 --> 01:47:18,026
She loves me.

1853
01:47:20,464 --> 01:47:22,398
So, suck on that.

1854
01:47:31,086 --> 01:47:32,693
Take care, George.

1855
01:47:39,623 --> 01:47:41,004
Goddammit.

1856
01:48:02,544 --> 01:48:04,320
You embarrassed me.

1857
01:48:05,124 --> 01:48:07,138
Yeah, sorry 'bout that.

1858
01:48:09,955 --> 01:48:11,641
How'd your little
talk with George go?

1859
01:48:11,701 --> 01:48:12,936
Are we kidnapping him?

1860
01:48:12,961 --> 01:48:14,727
Not the word I'd use.

1861
01:48:14,793 --> 01:48:15,875
Well, now that
you've talked to him,

1862
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,095
do you believe
everything's all right?

1863
01:48:17,154 --> 01:48:18,632
Not exactly.

1864
01:48:19,277 --> 01:48:20,984
This was a mistake,
you should leave!

1865
01:48:21,074 --> 01:48:22,562
Way aheada 'ya

1866
01:48:27,028 --> 01:48:28,992
George isn't blind!

1867
01:48:29,389 --> 01:48:31,254

Well, I just figured we would.

1934
01:54:09,120 --> 01:54:11,771
I got a six-pack in the back,
thought we'd order a pizza.

1935
01:54:11,805 --> 01:54:12,798

Hey...

1941
01:54:49,013 --> 01:54:51,648
bought me an acid-dipped
cigarette today.

1942
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:52,932
Oh, yeah?

1943
01:54:53,321 --> 01:54:55,190
You wanna buy a
cigarette dipped in acid?

1944
01:54:55,339 --> 01:54:56,434
Yeah.

1945
01:54:57,056 --> 01:54:59,174
If I'm gonna trip,
I'm gonna trip here, man,

1946
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:00,655
walkin' the woods, not my home.

1947
01:55:03,268 --> 01:55:06,396
Just gonna stash it here,
don't smoke it by mistake.

1948
01:55:06,924 --> 01:55:09,813
You wanna smoke some, smoke
some, just save me some.

1949
01:55:10,241 --> 01:55:12,813
No, I don't need to
trip out on no acid.

Uh-oh.

Here comes trouble.

1964
01:55:59,623 --> 01:56:00,758
Boom!

1965
01:56:01,353 --> 01:56:03,107
Oh, man, right in the face.

1966
01:56:15,099 --> 01:56:16,607

That guy's a fuckin' prick.

Alright, get ready

After that Musso and
Frank's lunch meeting,

Marvin did provide Rick
job opportunities

1996
01:58:17,583 --> 01:58:19,139
in the Italian film industry.

1997
01:58:19,326 --> 01:58:22,135
Rick Dalton, Marvin Schwarz here.
Hold on.

Yes, Mr. Schwarz.

2000

Two words: Nebraska Jim,
Sergio Corbucci.

2001
01:58:30,376 --> 01:58:33,424
N-Nebraska what? Sergio who?

2002
01:58:33,514 --> 01:58:35,086
<i>Sergio Corbucci.</i>

2003
01:58:35,165 --> 01:58:36,490
And who's that.

2004
01:58:36,747 --> 01:58:39,001
The second best director
of Spaghetti Westerns

2005
01:58:39,035 --> 01:58:40,502
in the whole, wide world.

2006
01:58:40,615 --> 01:58:43,449
He's doing a new Western,
it's called Nebraska Jim.

2007
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:46,009
And because of me,
he's considering you.

2008
01:58:47,490 --> 01:58:49,228
<i>Well, Rick got Nebraska Jim.</i>

2009
01:58:49,413 --> 01:58:51,659
<i>And Rick made a rather
compelling Nebraska Jim</i>

2010
01:58:51,699 --> 01:58:53,342
<i>existing quite nicely within</i>

2011
01:58:53,373 --> 01:58:56,683
<i>Sergio Corbucci's rogues' gallery
of antiheroes.</i>

2012
01:58:57,786 --> 01:58:59,992
<i>In Rome, Rick loved the paparazzi</i>

2013
01:59:00,072 --> 01:59:01,611
<i>and the fuss they made over him</i>

2014
01:59:01,636 --> 01:59:04,400
<i>and his Nebraska Jim co-star,
Daphna Ben-Cobo</i>

2015
01:59:05,189 --> 01:59:06,785
Right there, paparazzo.

2016
01:59:06,843 --> 01:59:08,415
<i>What about me-a Rick!</i>

2017
01:59:08,948 --> 01:59:10,336
<i>He loved the food so much</i>

2018
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:13,321
<i>that during his stay,
Rick gained almost 15 pounds.</i>

2019
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:16,779
<i>But he didn't love the
Italians' way of making movies.</i>

2020
01:59:16,831 --> 01:59:18,108
<i>In fact, he thought
the post synched</i>

2021

<i>every actor speaks
their own language</i>

2022

<i>Tower of Babel shooting

<i>While in Rome,</i>

2025
01:59:26,225 --> 01:59:29,106
<i>Marvin plugged Rick into three
other Italian productions.</i>

<i>His second Western was</i>

2027
01:59:30,749 --> 01:59:32,971
<i>Kill Me Quick, Ringo,

2028
01:59:33,096 --> 01:59:34,658
<i>Also starring Joseph Cotten</i>

<i>pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.</i>

2031
01:59:39,189 --> 01:59:41,721
<i>His third was an
Italian-Spanish co-production</i>

2032
01:59:41,789 --> 01:59:45,869
<i>that paired him with Telly Savalas
titled, Red Blood, Red Skin.</i>

<i>Ultimately making Rick's</i>

<i>six-month Italian sojourn

2042
02:00:48,339 --> 02:00:50,339
<i>Although his swank
Roman apartment</i>

2043
02:00:50,427 --> 02:00:52,355
<i>ate up a big chunk
of his earnings.</i>

2044
02:00:54,070 --> 02:00:56,927
<i>So, as Rick return to
Hollywood via Pan-Am...</i>

2045
02:00:57,270 --> 02:00:59,317
<i>he has four new
movies under his belt,</i>

2046
02:00:59,342 --> 02:01:00,834
<i>some money in his pocket,</i>

2047
02:01:00,886 --> 02:01:03,362
<i>and his brand spanking new
Italian wife</i>

2048
02:01:03,842 --> 02:01:05,858
<i>Scarlett Francesca Capucci.</i>

2049
02:01:08,705 --> 02:01:10,641
<i>Hurtling through the
air towards a new life</i>

2050
02:01:10,666 --> 02:01:12,380
<i>and uncertain future,</i>

2051
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:15,661
<i>Rick was really not sure
about what lay ahead for him.</i>

2052
02:01:19,009 --> 02:01:20,413
<i>Way back in coach,</i>

2053
02:01:20,438 --> 02:01:22,826
<i>working on his
bottomless Bloody Mary,</i>

2054
02:01:22,932 --> 02:01:26,154
<i>Cliff Booth returned
to Los Angeles as well.</i>

2055
02:01:26,771 --> 02:01:31,232
<i>He kept Rick company during his
entire six-month stay in Italy.</i>

2056
02:01:32,093 --> 02:01:34,585
However, as the two men
returned home,

2057
02:01:34,971 --> 02:01:36,423
they've come to
an understanding.

2058
02:01:36,503 --> 02:01:38,019
Here it goes now.

2059
02:01:39,206 --> 02:01:40,595
With the, uh...

2060
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:43,523
with the new wife, I, uh...

2061
02:01:44,670 --> 02:01:47,582
I just, I-I can't afford
you anymore, Cliff.

2062
02:01:47,773 --> 02:01:48,708
You know.

2063
02:01:48,733 --> 02:01:51,452
I could barely afford
my own house anymore.

2064
02:01:51,501 --> 02:01:53,596
So, the plan is to...

2065
02:01:53,621 --> 02:01:55,163
sell the house and buy...

2066
02:01:55,188 --> 02:01:57,347
buy a condo i-in Toluca Lake,

2067
02:01:57,418 --> 02:02:00,484
bank the money, you know,
live off it, that type of thing.

2068
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:03,376
Hopefully I'll score
come next pilot season.

2069
02:02:03,982 --> 02:02:05,219
It's a good plan.

2070
02:02:05,244 --> 02:02:06,340
Yeah.

2071
02:02:07,413 --> 02:02:10,583
But I don't know if I
have a career or not, if...

2072
02:02:10,709 --> 02:02:13,668
I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says

2073
02:02:13,702 --> 02:02:16,490
or if I'm
one step closer to

2074
02:02:16,551 --> 02:02:18,066
going back to Missouri.

2075
02:02:18,991 --> 02:02:21,539
When this whole European
journey's over,

2076
02:02:21,594 --> 02:02:23,372
I think we've, uh...

2077
02:02:24,502 --> 02:02:26,572
we've reached the
end of the trail, Cliff.

2078
02:02:38,145 --> 02:02:40,057
<i>So, these last four
Italian flicks,</i>

2079
02:02:40,121 --> 02:02:41,661
<i>after nine years together,</i>

2080
02:02:41,886 --> 02:02:44,172
<i>would be Rick and Cliff's
final rodeo.</i>

2081
02:02:45,117 --> 02:02:47,443
<i>Cliff doesn't have a
clue what he's gonna do.</i>

2082
02:02:47,698 --> 02:02:50,016
<i>The only thing the two
men know of for sure,</i>

2083
02:02:50,088 --> 02:02:53,470
<i>tonight, Rick and Cliff will have
a good, old-fashioned drunk.</i>

2084
02:02:53,701 --> 02:02:57,017
<i>Both men know once the plane
touches down in El Segundo,</i>

2085
02:02:57,042 --> 02:02:59,344
<i>it'll be an end of an era
for both of them.</i>

2086
02:02:59,509 --> 02:03:02,128
<i>When you come to the end of
the line with a buddy who is</i>

2087
02:03:02,179 --> 02:03:04,572
<i>more than a brother
and a little less than a wife,</i>

2088
02:03:04,602 --> 02:03:05,864
<i>getting blind drunk together</i>

2089
02:03:05,889 --> 02:03:08,713

02:14:12,435 --> 02:14:13,547
Who are you?

2264
02:14:13,705 --> 02:14:14,959
And who are you here to see, huh?

2265
02:14:15,049 --> 02:14:17,636
Nobody, sir. We just got lost.
I'm a little turned around.

2266
02:14:17,701 --> 02:14:19,002
Ah, horseshit.

2267
02:14:22,039 --> 02:14:25,484
Fuckin' hippies came up here to
smoke dope on a dark road, huh?

2268
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:28,204
Next time you wanna try that,
fix your fuckin' muffler.

2269
02:14:28,365 --> 02:14:30,261
Look, we're really
sorry we disturbed you.

2270
02:14:30,335 --> 02:14:32,319
Look, chief,
you don't belong here.

2271
02:14:32,499 --> 02:14:34,463
Now take this mechanical asshole

2272
02:14:34,597 --> 02:14:37,305
and get it off my fuckin' street!

2273
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:50,959
Hey!

2274
02:14:51,373 --> 02:14:52,556
Dennis Hopper!

2275
02:14:52,595 --> 02:14:54,178
Move this fuckin' piece of shit.

2276
02:14:54,266 --> 02:14:56,544
All right, well, just give me
a moment to turn it around.

2277
02:14:56,624 --> 02:14:58,449
Well, drive it backwards, numbnuts.

2278
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:00,428
Fuckin' drive it and drive it now!

2279
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,170
Okay, okay, stop yellin'.

2280
02:15:02,210 --> 02:15:03,622
Hold your horses. We're leavin'.

2281
02:15:03,995 --> 02:15:07,527

2282
02:15:07,648 --> 02:15:10,656
The hell you lookin' at,
you little ginger hair fucker?

2283
02:15:11,542 --> 02:15:14,367
Hey, come around here again,
I'm gonna call the fuckin' cops.

2284
02:15:21,380 --> 02:15:23,078
Dirty fuckin' hippies.

2285
02:15:36,112 --> 02:15:38,891
Very fancy fucking house,
thinks we're animals.

2286
02:15:38,916 --> 02:15:40,099
But he's seen us.

2287
02:15:40,274 --> 02:15:42,123
He's awake. He's awake.

2288
02:15:42,456 --> 02:15:43,560
They're all awake.

2289
02:15:43,641 --> 02:15:45,086
They're listening to fucking records.

2290
02:15:45,141 --> 02:15:46,880
Everybody's fucking awake!

2291
02:15:46,962 --> 02:15:48,058
Look!

2292
02:15:48,145 --> 02:15:49,423
What did Charlie say?

2293
02:15:49,497 --> 02:15:50,677
He said...

2294
02:15:50,751 --> 02:15:52,521
"Go to Terry's old house

2295
02:15:52,592 --> 02:15:54,537
"and kill everybody in there."

2296
02:15:54,986 --> 02:15:56,525
And you heard him yourself.

2297
02:15:56,916 --> 02:15:58,726
He said make it witchy.

2298
02:15:58,950 --> 02:16:01,387
Now, he either said that...

2299
02:16:01,799 --> 02:16:03,545
or I'm a liar.

2300
02:16:04,981 --> 02:16:06,767
Now, are anyone o' you...

2301
02:16:06,823 --> 02:16:08,108
calling me a liar?

2302
02:16:09,158 --> 02:16:10,126
Hmm?

2303
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:12,398
How about you?

2304
02:16:12,898 --> 02:16:14,557
Are you calling me a liar?

2305
02:16:15,847 --> 02:16:17,419
No, of course not.

2306
02:16:17,986 --> 02:16:18,954
Good.

2307
02:16:19,025 --> 02:16:20,184
Hold it.

2308
02:16:20,494 --> 02:16:22,097
Was that Rick Dalton?

2309
02:16:22,189 --> 02:16:23,173
Who?

2310
02:16:23,237 --> 02:16:24,355
The guy from Bounty Law.

2311
02:16:24,387 --> 02:16:25,554
Who, Jake Cahill?

2312
02:16:25,596 --> 02:16:28,819
Yeah! That guy in the road
was Jake Cahill.

2313
02:16:28,847 --> 02:16:30,141
Ho... wait a minute.

2314
02:16:30,189 --> 02:16:32,816
That was fucking Jake Cahill
that just yelled at us?

2315
02:16:33,214 --> 02:16:35,056
He was older,
but yeah, I think so.

2316
02:16:35,098 --> 02:16:36,336
Who's this Rick guy?

2317
02:16:36,371 --> 02:16:38,283
Jesus Christ, Sadie,
get it together!

2318
02:16:38,326 --> 02:16:39,627
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill

2319
02:16:39,652 --> 02:16:41,881
on a cowboy show in the
50s called Bounty Law.

2320
02:16:41,963 --> 02:16:43,661
Fuck you, Katie.

2321
02:16:43,694 --> 02:16:46,845
Sorry I don't know the name of
every fascist dog TV in the 50s.

2322
02:16:46,968 --> 02:16:49,706
I can't believe that
asshole in the road

2323
02:16:49,746 --> 02:16:51,409
was Jake Cahill!

2324
02:16:51,490 --> 02:16:54,411
When I was a kid,
I had a Bounty Law lunch box.

2325
02:16:54,437 --> 02:16:57,381
That was my favorite
of all my lunch boxes.

2326
02:16:58,099 --> 02:17:00,060
Dig this...

2327
02:17:00,889 --> 02:17:02,603
You've been having
our trip session,

2328
02:17:02,628 --> 02:17:05,115
I've been expanding on
this one idea in my head.

2329
02:17:05,615 --> 02:17:06,901
Alright, dig it.

2330
02:17:07,163 --> 02:17:09,441
We all grew up watchin' TV,
you know what I mean?

2331
02:17:10,566 --> 02:17:12,510
And if you grew up watchin' TV,

2332
02:17:12,574 --> 02:17:14,431
that means you grew up
watchin' murder.

2333
02:17:15,321 --> 02:17:18,639
Every show on TV
that wasn't I-I Love Lucy

2334
02:17:18,710 --> 02:17:19,909
was about murder.

2335
02:17:20,262 --> 02:17:22,572
So, my idea is...

2336
02:17:23,123 --> 02:17:25,615
we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

2337
02:17:27,588 --> 02:17:29,120
I mean, where the
fuck are we, man?

2338
02:17:29,168 --> 02:17:31,533
We are in fucking Hollywood, man!

2339
02:17:31,585 --> 02:17:33,109
The people an entire generation

2340
02:17:33,134 --> 02:17:35,427
grew up watching kill
people live here.

2341
02:17:35,562 --> 02:17:37,839
And they live in
pigshit fucking luxury.

2342
02:17:37,931 --> 02:17:39,106
I say, fuck 'em.

2343
02:17:39,164 --> 02:17:41,507
I say we cut their cocks up
and make 'em eat it.

2344
02:17:42,213 --> 02:17:43,951
That's a great idea, Sadie.

2345
02:17:46,481 --> 02:17:48,338
You two ready to kill some pigs?

2346
02:17:57,644 --> 02:17:58,739
Wait a minute.

2347
02:17:58,905 --> 02:17:59,993
Uh, shit.

2348
02:18:00,199 --> 02:18:02,382
Sor... I forgot my knife
in the car.

2349
02:18:03,020 --> 02:18:04,425
Can I go-
Can I go back and get it?

2350
02:18:05,566 --> 02:18:07,041
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

2351
02:18:07,558 --> 02:18:08,820
- Wait a minute.
- What?

2352
02:18:08,891 --> 02:18:11,050
I locked the car.
You'll need keys to get in.

2353
02:18:14,231 --> 02:18:15,128
Oh.

2354
02:18:15,390 --> 02:18:16,326
Right.

2355
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:17,636
Thank you.

2356
02:18:17,771 --> 02:18:19,305
Okay. I'll be right back.

2357
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:21,140
Hurry up.

2358
02:18:21,165 --> 02:18:22,926
Yes, uh, just-just a little minute.

2359
02:18:33,312 --> 02:18:34,899
Ooh, that fucking bitch!

2360
02:18:34,962 --> 02:18:36,129
Shhh, calm down.

2361
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:37,728
There's a fuckin'
house right there.

2362
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:40,438
What do we do now?

2363
02:18:40,517 --> 02:18:41,994
Well, we do
what we came to do.

2364
02:18:42,067 --> 02:18:44,307
And when we're done, we just
split up and hitch home.

2365
02:18:44,911 --> 02:18:47,093
Any more questions, hmm?

2366
02:18:49,464 --> 02:18:50,781
Okay, pig killers.

2367
02:18:50,861 --> 02:18:52,289
Let's kill some piggies.

2368
02:19:06,327 --> 02:19:07,931
Oh, somebody's hungry.

2369
02:19:16,917 --> 02:19:17,941
All right.

2370
02:19:20,044 --> 02:19:21,378
It's feedin' time.

2371
02:19:24,790 --> 02:19:26,036
Brandy, couch.

2372
02:19:32,583 --> 02:19:34,194
And don't you move.

2373
02:19:42,495 --> 02:19:43,487
Oh, man...

2374
02:19:47,143 --> 02:19:48,016
Aaah...

2375
02:19:53,603 --> 02:19:55,333
The train has left the station.

2376
02:19:57,098 --> 02:19:58,043

2377
02:19:58,957 --> 02:19:59,814
Aaah!

2378
02:20:02,409 --> 02:20:03,544

2397
02:23:22,905 --> 02:23:25,032
Well, get him, bring him
into the living room.

2398
02:23:26,266 --> 02:23:27,472
What if he says no?

2399
02:23:27,497 --> 02:23:29,450
Don't take no for an answer.
You're the one with the knife.

2400

2404
02:24:03,725 --> 02:24:04,835

2406
02:24:11,549 --> 02:24:12,486

Who the fuck's that?

2409
02:24:17,049 --> 02:24:18,049

your white, little face.

2421
02:24:50,829 --> 02:24:53,059

02:29:03,792 --> 02:29:04,951
Francesca!

2441
02:29:05,229 --> 02:29:06,483
Francesca, honey!

2442
02:29:27,845 --> 02:29:30,384
<i>Sir, around what time was it that
you confronted the intruders?</i>

2443
02:29:31,005 --> 02:29:32,950
<i>About, uh, about midnight.</i>

2444
02:29:32,975 --> 02:29:34,388
<i>- Around midnight?
- Yeah.</i>

2445
02:29:34,437 --> 02:29:35,762
<i>How do you know
it was midnight?</i>

2446
02:29:35,923 --> 02:29:39,407
<i>Well... I was, uh...
I was in the kitchen, uh...</i>

2447
02:29:39,902 --> 02:29:41,736
<i>makin' margaritas and, uh...</i>

2448
02:29:42,456 --> 02:29:45,004
<i>I heard the sound
of a noisy muffler,</i>

2449
02:29:45,091 --> 02:29:47,141
<i>I looked up at the
clock, it said, uh...</i>

2450
02:29:47,166 --> 02:29:48,665
<i>the kitchen clock said midnight.</i>

2451
02:29:48,819 --> 02:29:50,604
<i>12:00 exactly?</i>

2452
02:29:50,761 --> 02:29:53,629
It could've been 12:05,
somethin' like that.

2453
02:29:53,654 --> 02:29:54,701
And you didn't see 'em again

2454
02:29:54,726 --> 02:29:56,479
until the woman attacked
you in the pool?

2455
02:29:57,398 --> 02:29:58,533
No. No.

2456
02:29:59,462 --> 02:30:01,454
What did these perpetrators do?

2457
02:30:01,589 --> 02:30:03,811
Perpetrators?
They were hippie assholes.

2458
02:30:04,403 --> 02:30:07,180
Two of 'em burst through
the front door there...

2459
02:30:07,922 --> 02:30:11,438
And the guy hippie said
he was the devil.

2460
02:30:12,348 --> 02:30:14,308
And he said, "I'm here to...

2461
02:30:15,165 --> 02:30:17,380
do some... devil shit."

2462
02:30:17,446 --> 02:30:19,517
It's not verbatim, but...

2463
02:30:20,099 --> 02:30:21,195
Some devil shit?

2464
02:30:21,282 --> 02:30:22,806
Yeah, devil shit.

2465
02:30:36,693 --> 02:30:38,900
And away we go!

2466
02:30:42,794 --> 02:30:44,817
W-W-Wait a minute.

2467
02:30:44,905 --> 02:30:47,238
What hospital you goin' to, Cliff?
I'll meet you there, huh?

2468
02:30:47,385 --> 02:30:49,727
Ah, you don't wanna
meet me in no hospital.

2469
02:30:50,004 --> 02:30:51,782
Why don't you take
care of your lady?

2470
02:30:51,834 --> 02:30:54,930
Hey, she just took five
fuckin' sleeping pills.

2471
02:30:55,044 --> 02:30:56,980
She'll be asleep
till Columbus Day.

2472
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:58,046
You guys'll probably have to

2473
02:30:58,071 --> 02:31:00,269
come out here again
just to wake her ass up.

2474
02:31:00,502 --> 02:31:02,795
Hey, I'm not gonna die,
I may get a limp

2475
02:31:02,820 --> 02:31:05,502
but I ain't gonna die,
it's not my time yet, man.

2476
02:31:05,604 --> 02:31:08,199
All right? No use waitin'
in some waitin' room.

2477
02:31:08,224 --> 02:31:10,987
Why don't you go lie naked
with that fine creature?

2478
02:31:11,465 --> 02:31:14,060
Come visit me tomorrow.
Bring bagels.

2479
02:31:15,874 --> 02:31:18,080
You wanna do somethin' for me,
check on Brandy.

2480
02:31:18,105 --> 02:31:20,178
She may be a little
shook up after that.

2481
02:31:20,203 --> 02:31:21,254
She may wanna sleep with ya.

2482
02:31:21,279 --> 02:31:22,516
Are you kiddin' me?

2483
02:31:22,564 --> 02:31:24,135
She's sleeping with
Francesca right now.

2484
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:25,764
You might never get her back.

2485
02:31:26,695 --> 02:31:27,606
We gotta go.

2486
02:31:27,631 --> 02:31:29,154
All right then, Cliff.

2487
02:31:29,789 --> 02:31:30,868
See you tomorrow, then.

2488
02:31:34,327 --> 02:31:35,890
Hey! Hey...

2489
02:31:39,626 --> 02:31:41,284
You're a good friend, Cliff.

2490
02:31:42,912 --> 02:31:44,198
I try.

2491
02:32:16,419 --> 02:32:17,491
Hello?

2492
02:32:19,415 --> 02:32:20,439
Hey.

2493
02:32:20,558 --> 02:32:22,836
I'm Jay Sebring, I'm a
friend of the Polanskis.

2494
02:32:23,555 --> 02:32:25,721
You're Rick Dalton, right?

2495
02:32:26,359 --> 02:32:29,463
Yeah, yeah... I'm Rick Dalton.

2496
02:32:29,972 --> 02:32:31,877
- I live next door.
- Oh, I know.

2497
02:32:31,902 --> 02:32:34,624
I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.

2498
02:32:34,803 --> 02:32:36,731
If she ever wants to put
a bounty on Roman's head,

2499
02:32:36,771 --> 02:32:38,358
she just has to go
next door, right?

2500
02:32:40,161 --> 02:32:41,320
No shit?

2501
02:32:42,026 --> 02:32:44,376
What the fuck happened?

2502
02:32:44,577 --> 02:32:48,252
Oh, these... these fucking
hippie weirdos, th-they...

2503
02:32:48,324 --> 02:32:49,847
they broke into my house.

2504
02:32:50,439 --> 02:32:51,971
What do you mean,
like, trying to rob you?

2505
02:32:52,111 --> 02:32:53,960
I don't know what
the fuck they wanted...

2506
02:32:54,206 --> 02:32:56,269
Were they robbin' me?
I don't know, were they...

2507
02:32:56,343 --> 02:32:58,184
freakin' out on
some bummer trip?

2508
02:32:58,209 --> 02:32:59,554
Who knows, but...

2509
02:32:59,579 --> 02:33:01,642
they tried to kill
my wife and my buddy.

2510
02:33:01,745 --> 02:33:03,191
Jesus Christ, are you serious?

2511
02:33:03,232 --> 02:33:05,066
Yeah, I'm fuckin' serious.

2512
02:33:05,203 --> 02:33:08,378
My buddy and his dog
killed two of 'em, and, uh...

2513
02:33:09,044 --> 02:33:11,846
shit, I... torched the last one.

2514
02:33:12,065 --> 02:33:13,938
- Torched?
- Yeah.

2515
02:33:14,295 --> 02:33:15,962
I burned her ass to a crisp.

2516
02:33:16,604 --> 02:33:17,707
How'd you do that?

2517
02:33:17,938 --> 02:33:19,422
Believe it or not, I...

2518
02:33:19,787 --> 02:33:21,889
I got a flamethrower
in my tool shed.

2519
02:33:21,914 --> 02:33:24,157
From The Fourteen Fists of McCluskey?

2520
02:33:24,547 --> 02:33:25,658
Yeah!

2521
02:33:26,648 --> 02:33:27,632
Yeah.

2522
02:33:27,657 --> 02:33:29,521
Th-That's the one.

2523
02:33:29,596 --> 02:33:31,167
It still works, too.

2524
02:33:31,294 --> 02:33:32,493
Thank God.

2525
02:33:32,784 --> 02:33:34,395
Hey, is everybody okay?

2526
02:33:34,459 --> 02:33:35,657
Well...

2527
02:33:35,819 --> 02:33:37,152
the fuckin' hippies aren't.

2528
02:33:37,306 --> 02:33:38,493
That's for goddamn sure.

2529
02:33:38,548 --> 02:33:39,628
Yeah.

2530
02:33:39,653 --> 02:33:41,486
But I'm fine, you know, uh...

2531
02:33:41,595 --> 02:33:43,595
my wife's fine, we're just, uh...

2532
02:33:43,709 --> 02:33:45,368
a little shook up, is all.

2533
02:33:45,466 --> 02:33:47,011
Oh, my God, that's terrifying.

2534
02:33:47,469 --> 02:33:48,532
Yeah.

2535
02:33:48,850 --> 02:33:51,477
<i>Jay, honey,
is everything all right?</i>

2536
02:33:51,635 --> 02:33:53,310
Everything's okay now, honey.

2537
02:33:53,455 --> 02:33:56,368
Uh, but hippies broke
into the house next door.

2538
02:33:56,650 --> 02:33:58,095
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2539
02:33:58,456 --> 02:33:59,974
<i>Well, that's terrifying.</i>

2540
02:34:00,543 --> 02:34:02,138
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2541
02:34:02,338 --> 02:34:05,926
I'm talking to your next door
neighbor about it right now.

2542
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:07,727
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

2543
02:34:09,369 --> 02:34:11,227
Yeah! That's me.

2544
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:14,519
<i>Oh! Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

2545
02:34:15,218 --> 02:34:16,655
<i>Everybody okay?</i>

2546
02:34:17,209 --> 02:34:20,248
Yes, yes, Sharon,
e-everybody's fine.

2547
02:34:20,280 --> 02:34:21,661
<i>Are you okay?</i>

2548
02:34:23,955 --> 02:34:25,697
Yes, I am, thank you
for asking that.

2549
02:34:27,181 --> 02:34:29,688
<i>Rick, would you like to come
up to the house for a drink</i>

2550
02:34:29,721 --> 02:34:31,189
<i>meet my other friends?</i>

2551
02:34:37,559 --> 02:34:40,543
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

2552
02:34:40,717 --> 02:34:43,558
<i>Oh, hooray!
Great, I'll buzz you up.</i>

2553
02:34:59,430 --> 02:35:01,628
Hey, man, nice to meet you.

2554
02:35:01,832 --> 02:35:03,030
I'm Jay Sebring.

2555
02:35:31,608 --> 02:35:32,886
Hi, Rick.

2556
02:35:33,004 --> 02:35:34,498
Sharon, hi.

2557
02:35:34,559 --> 02:35:37,019
Oh, it's so nice to
finally meet you.

2558
02:35:37,373 --> 02:35:38,667
Nice to meet you.

2559
02:38:26,631 --> 02:38:28,583
Hi, this is Rick Dalton

2560
02:38:28,608 --> 02:38:31,092
better known as bounty
hunter Jake Cahill.

2561
02:38:31,303 --> 02:38:34,647
Speaking on behalf of
Red Apple Cigarettes.

2562
02:38:34,850 --> 02:38:37,904
Now, I smoke Red Apples,
been smokin' 'em for years.

2563
02:38:37,929 --> 02:38:42,881
But since the Red Apple Tobacco
Comany's been around since 1862,

2564
02:38:43,053 --> 02:38:46,170
you'll see Jake Cahill
smoke Red Apple, too.

2565
02:38:46,412 --> 02:38:48,106
Now, back in Jake's day,

2566
02:38:48,139 --> 02:38:51,272
Red Apple came in a pouch
and he had to roll his own.

2567
02:38:51,646 --> 02:38:54,646
But today, Red Apple
comes factory-rolled.

2568
02:38:54,702 --> 02:38:58,209
For the best drag
with the best tobacco flavor

2569
02:38:58,280 --> 02:39:00,153
with less burn on your throat

2570
02:39:00,178 --> 02:39:02,982
than any other
non-filter cigarette.

2571
02:39:09,264 --> 02:39:10,327
Mm.

2572
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:14,678
Now, that's the way a
cigarette should taste.

2573
02:39:14,741 --> 02:39:15,903
Hm.

2574
02:39:15,928 --> 02:39:18,506
Better drag, more flavor,

2575
02:39:18,889 --> 02:39:20,491
less throat burn.

2576
02:39:22,873 --> 02:39:24,483
That's the Red Apple way.

2577
02:39:25,506 --> 02:39:28,241
So look for this
lifesize standee of me,

2578
02:39:28,294 --> 02:39:29,935
Jake Cahill wherever fine

2579
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:32,358
Red Apple tobacco
products are sold.

2580
02:39:32,889 --> 02:39:35,397
Take a bite and feel all right.

2581
02:39:36,342 --> 02:39:38,678
Take a bite of a Red Apple.

2582
02:39:39,662 --> 02:39:41,045
Tell 'em Jake sent ya.

2583
02:39:44,647 --> 02:39:45,764
And cut.

2584
02:39:45,789 --> 02:39:47,514
Alright, this cigarette
is fucking shit.

2585
02:39:47,539 --> 02:39:49,083
By the way, who
chose this photo, all right?

2586
02:39:49,108 --> 02:39:50,653
I have a double chin, all right?

2587
02:39:50,678 --> 02:39:52,585
Nobody noticed that crap?!
